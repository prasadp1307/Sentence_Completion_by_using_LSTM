Born in 1931, the son of a litte\\n educated boatowner in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu, he had\\n an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating\\n inthe highest civilan award of India, the Bharat Ratna\\n \\n As chief of the country\\'s defence research and\\n development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great\\n potential for dynamism and innovation that ested in\\n seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the\\n story of Kalam\\'s rise from obscurity and his personal and\\n professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi,\\n Akash, Trishul and Nag -missiles that have become\\n household names in India and that have raised the nation to\\n the level of a missile power of international recokoning\\n \\n At the same time as he has helped create India\\'s\\n awesome weaponry, Kalam has maintained the ascetic\\n rigour of his personal life, working 18 hours a day and\\n practicing the veena. With characteristic modesty, Kalam\\n ascribes the greatness of his achievement to the influence\\n of his teachers and mentors. He describes the struggles of\\n his boyhood and youth, bringing alive everyday life in a\\n small town in South India and the inspirational role of\\n educators. He describes the role of visionary Indian\\n scientists, such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai, and of the creation\\n of a coordinated network of research institutions. This is\\n also the saga of independent hdia\\'s struggle for\\n technological self sufficiency and defensive autonomy — a\\n story as much about politics, domestic and international, as\\n itis about science.\\n \\n ‘Arun Tiwari worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam for\\n over a decade in the Defence Research and Development\\n Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad. He is currently Director,\\n Cardiovascular Technology hstitute, Hyderabad, where he\\n is pursuing Dr Kalam\\'s vision of developing cost-effective\\n medical devices using indigenous defence tecmology.\\n \\n Dr Kalamis now hdia\\'s President.

This might seem to disqualify me as his\\n biographer, and I certainly had no notion of being one. One\\n day, while speaking to him, |\\n \\n asked him if he had a message for young Indians. His\\n message fascinated me. Later, I mustered the courage to\\n ask him about his recollections so that | could pen them\\n down before they were buried irretrievably under the sands\\n oftime.\\n \\n We had a long series of sittings late into the night and\\n early under the fading stars of dawn—all somehow stolen\\n from his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day. The\\n profundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me. He had\\n tremendous vitality and obviously received immense\\n pleasure from the world of ideas. His conversation was not\\n always easy to follow, but was alvays fresh and stimulating\\n There were complexities, subtleties, and _ intriguing\\n metaphors and subplots in his narrative, but gradually the\\n Unfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuous,\\n discourse.\\n \\n When Isat down to write this book, [elt that it required\\n greater skills than | possessed. But realising the\\n importance of this task and regarding it an honour fo have\\n been permitted to attempt it, | prayed eamestly for the\\n courage and calibre to complete it\\n \\n This book is written for the ordinary people of India for\\n whom Dr Kalam has an immense affection, and of whom\\n Dr Kalam is certainly one. He has an intuitive rapport with\\n the humblest and simplest people, an indication of his own\\n simplicity and innate spirituality.\\n \\n For myself, writing this book has been like a pilgrimage.\\n Through Dr Kalam, | was blessed with the revelation that\\n the real joy of living can be found in only one way—in one\\'s\\n communion with an eternal source of hidden knowledge\\n vwithin oneself—which each individual is bidden to seek and\\n find for himself or herself. Many of you may never meet Dr\\n Kalam in person, but | hope you will enjoy his company\\n through this book, and that he will become your spiritual\\n friend\\n \\n Icould include in this book only a few incidents among\\n the many narrated to me by Dr Kalam. In fact, this book\\n \\x0cprovides only a thumbnail sketch of Dr Kalam\\'s life. It is\\n quite possible that certain important incidents have been\\n inadvertenty dropped and that the contribution of some\\n individuals to the projects co-ordinated by Dr Kalam has\\n gone unrecorded. Since a quarter-century of professional\\n life separates me from Dr Kalam, some important issues\\n might also have remained unrecorded or have been\\n distorted. | am solely responsible for such shortcomings,\\n which are, of course, completely unintentional\\n \\n Arun Tiwari\\n \\n Acknowledgements Introduction\\n \\n 1\\n \\n wish to express my gratitude to all the people involved\\n in the writing of this book, especially Mr YS Rajan, Mr A\\n Sivathanu Pillai, Mr RN Aganwal, Mr Prahlada, Mr KVSS\\n Prasada Rao\\n \\n and Dr SK Salwan, who were very generous in sharing their\\n time and knowledge with me.\\n \\n Tam thankful to Prof. KAV Pandalai and Mr R\\n Swaminathan, for critical reviews of the text [thank Dr &\\n Soma Raju for his tangible, but always unspoken support,\\n for this project. My sincere thanks go to my wife and\\n unsparing critic, Dr Anjana Tiwari, for her tough comments,\\n accompanied with her gentle support\\n thas been a pleasure to work with Universities Press, and\\n the cooperation of the editorial and production staffis much\\n appreciated\\n \\n There are many fine people, such as the photographer\\n ‘Mr. Prabhu, who have selflessly enriched me and this book\\n inways beyond measure. Ithank them all\\n \\n ‘And finally, my deepest gratitude to my sons, Aseem\\n and Amol— for their unfailing emotional support during the\\n writing, and because I seek in them that attitude towards\\n life which Dr Kalam admired, and wanted this work to\\n reflect.\\n \\n Arun Tiwari\\n \\n This book is being released at a time when India\\'s\\n technological endeavours, to assert its sovereignty and\\n strengthen its security, are questioned by many in the world.\\n Historically, people have alvays fought among themselves\\n ‘on one issue or another. Prehistorically, battles were fought\\n ‘over food and shelter. With the passage of time, wars were\\n waged over religious and ideological beliefs; and now the\\n dominant struggle of sophisticated warfare is for economic\\n and technological supremacy. Consequently, economic\\n and technological supremacy is equated with political\\n power and world contol.\\n \\n Afew nations who have grown very strong\\n technologically, over the past few centuries, have wrested\\n control, for their own purposes. These major powers have\\n become the self-proclaimed leaders of the new world\\n order. What does a county of one billion people, ike India,\\n do in such a situation? We have no other option but to be\\n technologically strong. But, can India be a leader in the field\\n of technology? My answer is an emphatic ‘Yes’. And let me\\n validate my answer by narrating some incidents from my\\n life.\\n \\n When [first began the reminiscences that have gone\\n into this book, Iwas uncertain about which of my memories\\n were worth narrating or were of any relevance at all. My\\n childhood is precious to me, but would it be of interest to\\n anyone else? Was it worth the reader\\'s while, I wondered,\\n to know about the tribulations and triumphs of a smalttown\\n boy? Of the staitened circumstances of my schooldays, the\\n ‘odd jobs I did to pay my school fees, and how my decision\\n to become a vegetarian was part due to my financial\\n \\x0cconstraints as a college student—why should these be of\\n any interest to the general public? In the end, | was\\n corvinced that these were relevant, if not for anything else\\n but because they tell something of the story of modem\\n hia, as individual destiny and the social matrix in which it\\n is embedded cannot be seen in isolation. Having been\\n persuaded of this, it did seem germane to include the\\n accounts of my frustrated attempt to become an Air Force\\n pilot and of how I became, instead of the Collector my\\n father dreamed I would be, a racket engineer.\\n \\n Finally, I decided to describe the individuals who had a\\n profound influence on my life. This book is also by way of a\\n submission of thanks, therefore, to. my parents and\\n immediate family, and to the teachers and preceptors Iwas\\n fortunate to have had, both as a student and in my\\n professional life. I is also a tibute to the unflagging\\n enthusiasm and efforts of my young colleagues who helped\\n to realise our collective dreams. The famous words of Isaac\\n Newton about standing on the shoulders of giants are valid\\n for every scientist and | certain owe a great debt of\\n knowledge and inspiration to the distinguished lineage of\\n hdian scientists, that included Vikram Sarabhai, Satish\\n Dhawan and Brahm Prakash. They played major roles in\\n my ife and in the story of Indian science.\\n \\n I completed sixty years of age on 15 October 1991. | had\\n decided to devote my retirement to fulfilling what | saw as\\n my duties in the.\\n \\n sphere of social service. Instead, two things happened\\n simultaneously. First, | agreed to. continue in govemment\\n service for another three years and, next, a young\\n colleague, Arun Tiwari, requested me to share my\\n reminiscences with him, so that he could record them. He\\n was someone who had been working in my laboratory\\n since 1982, but I had never really known him well until the\\n February of 1987 when I visited him at the tensive\\n Coronary Care Unit of the Nizam\\'s Institute of Medical\\n Sciences in Hyderabad. He was a mere 22 years old, but\\n was fighting valiant for his life. | asked him if there was\\n anything he wanted me to do for him. “Give me your\\n blessings, sir\" he said, \"so that I may have a longer life and\\n can complete at least one of your projects.\\n \\n ‘The young man\\'s dedication moved me and I prayed for\\n tis recovery all right The Lord answered my prayers and\\n Tiwari was able to get back to work in a month. He did an\\n excellent job in helping to realise the Akash missile\\n airframe from scratch within the short space of three years.\\n He then took up the task of chroniciing my story. Over the\\n last year, he patiently transcribed the bits and pieces of my\\n story and converted them into a fluent namative. He also\\n went through my personal library meticulously and selected\\n from among the pieces of poetry those that | had marked\\n while reading, and included them in the text\\n \\n This story\\'s an account, Ihope, not just of my personal\\n triumphs and tibulations but of the successes and\\n setbacks of the science establishment in modern India,\\n struggling to establish itself in the technological forefront. I\\n is the story of national aspiration and of cooperative\\n endeavour. And, as I see it, the saga of hdia\\'s search for\\n scientific self-sufficiency and technological competence is,\\n a parable for our tmes\\n \\n Each individual creature on this beautiful planet is\\n created by God to fulfl a particular role. Whatever | have\\n achieved in lfe is through His help, and an expression of\\n His wil. He showered His grace on me through some\\n outstanding teachers and colleagues, and when I pay my\\n \\x0ctibutes to these fine persons, | am merely praising His\\n glory. All these rockets and missiles are His work through a\\n small person called Kalam, in order to tell the several-\\n rrillion mass of hdia, to never fee! small or helpless. We\\n are all bom with a divine fire in us. Our efforts should be to\\n give wings to this fire and fil the world with the glow of its\\n goodness.\\n \\n May God bless you!\\n \\n APJ Abdul Kalam\\n \\x0cORIENTATION\\n [1931 - 1963 ]\\n \\n This earth is His, to Him belong those vast and boundiess\\n skies;Both seas within Him rest, and yet in that small poot\\n \\n He fies.\\n ATHARVAVEDA Book 4, Hymn 16.\\n \\x0c1\\n \\n 1\\n \\n was bom into a middle-class Tamil family in the island\\n town of Rameswaram in the erstwhile Madras state. My\\n father, Jainulabdeen, had neither much formal education\\n nor much wealth;\\n \\n despite these disadvantages, he possessed great\\n innate wisdom and a tue generosity of spirit He had an\\n ideal helpmate in my mother, Ashiamma. | do not recall the\\n exact number of people she fed every day, but lam quite\\n certain that far more outsiders ate with us than all the\\n members of our own family put together.\\n \\n parents were widely regarded as an ideal couple.\\n My mother\\'s lineage was the more distinguished, one of\\n her forebears having been bestowed the title of ‘Bahadur\\n by the British\\n \\n Iwas one of many children—a short boy with rather\\n undistinguished looks, born to tall and handsome parents,\\n We lived in our ancestral house, which was built in the\\n middle ofthe 19th century. Itwas a fairly large pucca house,\\n made of limestone and brick, on the Mosque Street in\\n Rameswaram. My austere father used to avoid all\\n inessential comforts and luxuries. However, all necessities\\n were provided for, in terms of food, medicine or clothes. hy\\n fact I would say mine was a very secure childhood, both\\n materially and emotional\\n \\n Inommalyy ate with my mother, sitting on the floor of the\\n kitchen. She would place a banana leaf before me, on\\n which she then ladied rice and aromatic sambhar, a variety\\n of sharp, home-made pickles and a dollop of fresh coconut\\n chutney.\\n \\n The famous Shiva temple, which made Rameswaram\\n so sacred to pilgrims, was about a ten-minute walk from\\n ‘our house. Our locality was predominantly Muslim, but there\\n were quite a few Hindu families too, living amicably with\\n their Muslim neighbours. There was @ very old mosque in\\n ‘our locality where my father would take me for evening\\n prayers. I had not the faintest idea of the meaning of the\\n Arabic prayers chanted, but Iwas totaly convinced that they\\n reached God. When my father came out of the mosque\\n after the prayers, people of different religions would he\\n sitting outside, waiting for him. Many of them offered bowls,\\n of water to my father who would dip his fingertips in them\\n and say a prayer. This water was then carried home for\\n invalids. lalso remember people visiting our home to offer\\n thanks after being cured. My father always smiled and\\n asked them to thank Allah, the benevolent and merciful\\n \\n e high priest of Rameswaram temple, Pakshi\\n Lakshmana Sastry, was a very close fiend of my father\\'s,\\n One of the most vivid memories of my early childhood is of\\n the two men, each in his traditional attire, discussing\\n spiritual matters. When Iwas old enough to ask questions, |\\n asked my father about the relevance of prayer. My father\\n fold me there was nothing mysterious about prayer. Rather,\\n prayer made possible a communion of the spirit between\\n people. “When you pray,\" he said, \"you transcend your body\\n and become a part ofthe cosmos, which knows no division\\n of wealth, age, caste, or creed.”\\n \\n My feos could convey complex spldtual concent in\\n very simple, downto-earth Tamil. He once told me, “h his,\\n ‘own time, in Fis own place, in what he really is, and inthe\\n stage he has reached—good or had—every human being\\n is a specific element within the whole of the manifest divine\\n \\x0cBeing. So why be afraid of difficulties, sufferings and\\n problems? When troubles come, tty to understand the\\n relevance of your sufferings. Adversity always presents\\n ‘opportunities for introspection.”\\n \\n iny don\\'t you say this to the people who come to you\\n for help and advice?\" | asked my father. He put his hands\\n ‘on my shoulders and looked straight into my eyes. For quite\\n some time he said nothing, as if he was judging my\\n capacity to comprehend his words. Then he answered ina\\n low, deep voice. His answer filed me with a strange energy\\n and enthusiasm:\\n \\n ‘Whenever human beings find themselves alone, as a\\n natural reaction, they start looking for company. Whenever\\n they are in trouble, they look for someone to help them,\\n ‘Whenever they reach an impasse, they look to someone to\\n show them the way out. Every recurrent anguish, longing,\\n and desire finds its own special helper. For the people who\\n come to me in distress, lam but a go-between in their effort\\n {0 propitiate demonic forces with prayers and offerings.\\n This is not a correct approach at all and should never be\\n followed. One must understand the difference between a\\n fearridden vision of destiny and the vision that enables us\\n to seek the enemy of fulfilment within ourselves.\\n \\n Tremember my father staring his day at 4 a.m. by\\n reading the namaz before dawn. After the namaz, he used\\n to wak down to a small coconut grove we owned, about 4\\n mmiles from our home. He would retum, with about a dozen\\n coconuts tied together thrown over his shoulder, and only\\n then would he have his breakfast. This remained his routine\\n even when he was in his late sities.\\n \\n Thave throughout my life tried to emulate my father in my\\n ‘own world of science and technology. | have endeavoured\\n to understand the fundamental truths revealed to me by my\\n father, and feel convinced that there exists a divine power\\n that can lift one up from confusion, misery, melancholy and\\n failure, and guide one to one\\'s true place. And once an\\n individual severs his emotional and physical bondage, he is,\\n onthe road fo freedom, happiness and peace of mind.\\n \\n Iwas about six years old when my father embarked on\\n the project of building a wooden sailboat to take pilgrims\\n from Rameswaram to Dhanuskodi, (also called\\n Sethukkarai), and back. He worked at building the boat on\\n the seashore, with the help of a relative, Ahmed Jallaluddin,\\n who later married my sister, Zohara. | watched the boat\\n take shape. The wooden hull and bulkheads were\\n seasoned with the heat from wood fires. My father was\\n doing good business with the boat when, one day, a\\n cyclone bringing winds of over 100 miles per hour carried\\n away our boat, along with some of the landmass of\\n Sethukkarai. The Pamban Bridge collapsed with a train full\\n of passengers on it Until then, Ihad only seen the beauty of\\n the sea, now its uncontrollable energy came as a revelation\\n tome.\\n \\n By the time the boat met its untimely end, Ahmed\\n Jallaluddin had become a close friend of mine, despite the\\n difference in our ages. He was about 15 years older than |\\n and used to call me Azad. We used to go for long walks\\n together every evening. As we started from Mosque Street\\n and made our way towards the sandy shores of the island,\\n Jallaluddin and | talked mainly of spiritual matters. The\\n atmosphere of Rameswaram, with its flocking pilgrims, was,\\n conducive to such discussion. Our first halt would be at the\\n imposing temple of Lord Shiva. Circling around the temple\\n with the same reverence as any pilgrim from a distant part\\n ofthe country, we felt a flow of energy pass through us.\\n \\n Jalaluddin would tak about God as if he had a working\\n \\x0cpartnership with Him. He would present all his doubts to\\n God as if He were standing nearby to dispose of them. |\\n would stare at Jalaluddin and then look towards the large\\n groups of pilgrims around the temple, taking holy dips in the\\n sea, performing rituals and reciting prayers with a sense of\\n respect towards the same Unknown, whom we treat as the\\n formless Almighty. I never doubted that the prayers in the\\n temple reached the same destination as the ones offered\\n in our mosque. lonly wondered whether Jalaluddin had any\\n ‘other special connection to God. Jallaluddin’s schooling\\n had been limited, principally because of his family\\'s\\n straitened circumstances. This may have been the reason\\n why he always encouraged me to excel in my studies and\\n enjoyed my success vicariously Never did I find the\\n slightest trace of resentment in Jalaluddin for his\\n deprivation. Rather, he was always full of gratitude for\\n whatever life had chosen to give him.\\n \\n hcidentally, at the me | speak of, he was the only\\n person on the entire island who could write Engish. He\\n wrote letters for almost anybody in need, be they letters of\\n application or otherwise. Nobody of my acquaintance,\\n either in my family or in the neighbourhood even had\\n Jallaluddin\\'s level of education or any links of consequence\\n with the outside world. Jalaluddin always spake to me\\n about educated people, of scientific discoveries, of\\n contemporary literature, and of the achievements of\\n medical science. It was he who made me aware of a\\n ‘brave, new world\" beyond our narrow confines.\\n \\n h the humble environs of my boyhood, books were a\\n scarce commodity. By local standards, however, the\\n personal library of STR Manickam, a former ‘revolutionary\\n oF militant nationalist, was sizeable. He encouraged me to\\n read all | could and I offen visited his home to borrow\\n \\n ks.\\n \\n Another person who greatly influenced my boyhood was\\n my first cousin, Samsuddin. He was the sole distributor for\\n newspapers in Rameswaram. The newspapers would\\n arrive at Rameswaram station by the morning train from\\n Pamban. Samsuddin\\'s newspaper agency was a one-man\\n ‘organization catering to the reading demands of the 1,000-\\n strong literate population of Rameswaram town. These\\n newspapers were mainly bought to keep abreast of current\\n developments in the National dependence Movement, for\\n astrological reference or to check the bullion rates\\n prevailing in Madras. A few readers with a more\\n cosmopolitan outlook would discuss Hitler, Mahatma\\n Gandhi and Jinnah; almost all would finally flow into the\\n mighty political current of Periyar EV Ramaswamy\\'s\\n movement against high caste Hindus. Dinamani was the\\n most sought after newspaper. Since reading the printed\\n matter was beyond my capability, | had to satisfy myself\\n with glancing at the pictures in the newspaper before\\n Samsuddin delivered them to his customers.\\n \\n ‘The Second World War broke out in 1939, when I was\\n eight years old. For reasons | have never been able to\\n understand, a sudden demand for tamarind seeds erupted\\n in the market | used fo collect the seeds and sell them toa\\n provision shop on Mosque Street. A day\\'s collection would\\n fetch me the princely sum of one anna. Jallaluddin would tell\\n me stories about the war which | would later attempt to\\n trace in the headlines in Dinamani. Our area, being\\n isolated, was completely unaffected by the war. But soon\\n hidia was forced to join the Allied Forces and something\\n like a state of emergency was declared. The first casualty\\n came in the form of the suspension of the train hait at\\n \\x0cRameswaram station. The newspapers now had to be\\n bundled and thrown out from the moving train on the\\n Rameswaram Road between Rameswaram — and\\n Dhanuskodi. That forced Samsuddin to look for a helping\\n hand to catch the bundles and, as if naturally, filled the slot\\n Samsuddin helped me eam my first wages. Half a century\\n later, I can stil feel the surge of pride in eaming my own\\n money for the first time\\n \\n Every child is bom, with some inherited characteristics,\\n into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment,\\n and trained in certain ways by figures of authority |\\n inherited honesty and self-discipline from my father, from\\n my mother, linherited faith in goodness and deep kindness\\n and so did my three brothers and sister. But itwas the time\\n I spent with Jalaluddin and Samsuddin that perhaps\\n contributed most to the uniqueness of my childhood and\\n made all the difference in my later life. The unschooled\\n wisdom of Jalaluddin and Samsuddin was so intuitive and\\n responsive to non-verbal messages, that I can\\n unhesitatingly attribute my subsequenty manifested\\n creativity to their company in my childhood.\\n \\n Thad three close fiends in my childhood—Ramanadha\\n Sastry, Aravindan, and Sivaprakasan. All these boys were\\n from orthodox Hindu Brahmin families. As children, none of\\n us ever felt any difference amongst ourselves because of\\n ‘our religious differences and upbringing. fact,\\n Ramanadha Sastry was the son of Pakshi Lakshmana\\n Sastry, the high priest of the Rameswaram temple. Later,\\n he took over the priesthood of the Rameswaram temple\\n from his father; Aravindan went into the business of\\n arranging transport for visiting pilgrims; and Sivaprakasan\\n became a catering contractor for the Southern Railways.\\n \\n During the annual Shri Sita Rama Kalyanam ceremony,\\n our family used to arrange boats with a special platform for\\n carrying idols of the Lord from the temple to the marriage\\n site, situated in the middle of the pond called Rama Tirtha\\n \\\\which was near our house. Events from the Ramayana and\\n from the life of the Prophet were the bedtime stories my\\n mother and grandmother would tell the children in our\\n family.\\n \\n One day when | was in the fifth standard at the\\n Rameswaram Elementary School, a new teacher came to\\n ‘our class. | used to wear a cap which marked me as a\\n Muslim, and | always satin the front row next to Ramanadha\\n Sastry, who wore a sacred thread. The new teacher could\\n not stomach a Hindu priest\\'s son sitting with a Muslim boy.\\n h accordance with our social ranking as the new teacher\\n saw it, Iwas asked to go and sit on the back bench, I felt\\n very sad, and so did Ramanadha Sastry, He looked utterly\\n downeast as I shifted to my seat in the last row. The image\\n of him weeping when | shifted to the last row left a lasting\\n impression on me.\\n \\n After school, we went home and told our respective\\n parents about the incident Lakshmana Sastry summoned\\n the teacher, and in our presence, told the teacher that he\\n should not spread the poison of social inequality and\\n communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children. He\\n bluntly asked the teacher to either apologize or quit the\\n school and the island. Not only did the teacher regret his,\\n behaviour, but the strong sense of conviction Lakshmana\\n Sastry conveyed ult mately reformed this young teacher.\\n \\n the whole, the small society of Rameswaram was\\n highly stratified and very rigid in terms ofthe segregation of\\n different social groups. However, my science teacher\\n Sivasubramaria Wer, though an orthodox Brahmin with a\\n very conservative wife, was something of a rebel. He did\\n \\x0chis best to break social barriers so that people from varying\\n backgrounds could mingle easily. He used to spend hours\\n \\n e and would say, ‘Kalam, Iwant you to develop so\\n that you are on par with the highly educated people of the\\n big cities.\"\\n \\n One day, he invited me to his home for a meal. His wife\\n was horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy being invited to\\n dine in her ritually pure kitchen. She refused fo serve me in\\n her kitchen. Sivasubramania lyer was not perturbed, nor did\\n he get angry with his wife, but instead, served me with his,\\n ‘own hands and sat down beside me to eat his meal. His\\n wife watched us from behind the kitchen door. I wondered\\n whether she had observed any difference in the way | ate\\n tice, drank water or cleaned the floor after the meal. When |\\n was leaving his house, Sivasubramania lyer invited me to\\n jin him for dinner again the next weekend. Observing my\\n hesitation, he told me not to get upset, saying, “Once you\\n decide to change the system, such problems have to he\\n confronted.” When | visited ‘his house the next week,\\n Sivasubramaria Wer\\'s wife took me inside her kitchen and\\n served me food with her own hands.\\n \\n Then the Second World War was over and hdia\\'s\\n freedom was imminent. “hdians wil build their own India,”\\n declared Gandhiji. The whole country was filed with an\\n Unprecedented optimism. lasked my father\\'s permission to\\n leave Rameswaram and study at the distiict headquarters,\\n in Ramanathapuram,\\n \\n He told me as if thinking aloud, \"Abul! I know you have\\n to go away to grow. Does the seagul not fly across the Sun,\\n alone and without a nest? You must forego your longing for\\n the land of your memories to move into the dwelling place\\n of your greater desires; our love will not bind you nor will our\\n needs hold you.\" He quoted Khalil Gibran to my hesitant\\n mother, \"Your children are not your children. They are the\\n sons and daughters of Life\\'s longing for itself. They come\\n through you but nat fom you. You may give them your love\\n but not your thoughts. For they have their own thoughts,\\n \\n He took me and my three brothers to the mosque and\\n recited the prayer Al Fatiha from the Holy Qur\\'an. As he put\\n \\n nn the train at Rameswaram station he said, ‘This\\n island may be housing your body but not your soul. Your\\n soul dwells in the house of tomorrow which none of us at\\n Rameswaram can visit, not even in our dreams. May God\\n bless you, my child!\"\\n \\n Samsuddin and Ahmed Jallaluddin travelled with me to\\n Ramanathapuram to enrol me in Schwartz High School,\\n and to arrange for my boarding there. Somehow, | did not\\n take to the new setting. The town of Ramanathapuram was\\n a thriving, factious town of some fifty thousand people, but\\n the coherence and harmony of Rameswaram was absent. |\\n missed my home and grabbed every opportunity to visit\\n Rameswaram. The pul of educational opportunities at\\n Ramanathapuram was not strong enough to nulify the\\n attraction of poli, a South hdian sweet my mother made. hy\\n fact, she used to prepare twelve distinctly different varieties\\n of it, bringing out the flavour of every single ingredient used\\n in the best possible combinations.\\n \\n Despite my homesickness, Iwas detemined to come\\n fo terms with the new environment because | knew my\\n father had invested great hopes in my success. My father\\n visualized me as a Collector in the making and [thought it\\n my duty o realise my father\\'s dream, although Idesperately\\n missed the familiarity security and comforts of\\n Rameswaram\\n \\n Jallaluddin used to speak to me about the power of\\n \\x0cpositive thinking and | often recalled his words when I felt\\n homesick or dejected. Itried hard to do as he said, which\\n was to stive to control my thoughts and my mind and,\\n through these, to influence my destiny, Fonically, that\\n destiny did not lead me back to Rameswaram, but rather,\\n swept me farther away from the home of my childhood\\n \\x0c2\\n \\n °\\n \\n nee | settled down at the Schwartz High School,\\n Ramanathapuram, the enthusiastic fifteen-year-old within\\n me re-emerged. My teacher, lyadurai Solomon, was an\\n ideal\\n \\n guide for an eager young mind that was yet uncertain of\\n the possibilities and alternatives that lay before it He made\\n his students feel very comfortable in class with his warm\\n and open-minded attitude. He used to say that a good\\n student could eam more from a bad teacher than a poor\\n student from even a skilled teacher.\\n \\n During my stay at Ramanathapuram, my relationship\\n vwith him grew beyond that of teacher and pupil. In his\\n company, | leamt that one coud exercise enormous\\n \\n Solomon used to say, ‘To succeed in life and achieve\\n results, you must understand and master three mighty\\n forces— desire, belief, and expectation.\" lyadurai Solomon,\\n who later became a Reverend, taught me that before\\n anything | wanted could happen, | had to desire it intensely\\n and be absolutely certain it would happen. To take an\\n example from my own life, I had been fascinated by the\\n mysteries of the sky and the fight of birds from early\\n childhood. | used to watch cranes and seagulls soar into\\n fight and longed to fly. Simple, provincial boy though Iwas, |\\n was convinced that one day |, too, would soar up into the\\n skies. Indeed, Iwas the first child from Rameswaram to fy.\\n \\n Solomon was a great teacher because he\\n instiled in all the children a sense of their own worth,\\n Solomon raised my seffesteem to a high point and\\n corvinced me, the son of parents who had not had the\\n benefits of education, that I too could aspire to become\\n whatever | wished. “With faith, you can change your\\n destiny,\" he would say.\\n \\n One day, when Iwas in the fourth form, my mathematics\\n teacher, Ramakrishna Wer, was teaching another class.\\n hhadvertentyy, | wandered into that classroom and in the\\n manner of an old-fashioned despot, Ramakrishna Wer\\n caught me by the neck and caned me in front of the whole\\n class. Many months later, when I scored full marks in\\n mathematics, he narrated the incident to the entire school\\n at moming assembly. “Whomsoever | cane becomes a\\n great man! Take my word, this boy is going to bring glory to\\n his school and to his teachers.\" His praise quite made up\\n for the earlier humiliation!\\n \\n By the time Icompleted my education at Schwartz, Iwas\\n a selfconfident boy detemmined to succeed. The decision to\\n gp | for fer education was taken without a second\\n \\n thought To us, in those days, the awareness of the\\n possibilities for a professional education did not exist;\\n higher education simply meant going to college. The\\n nearest’ college was at Tiruchchirappall, spelled\\n Trchingpaly toose days, and cated Tih for shot\\n 80, | arived at St Joseph\\'s College, Tiichi, to\\n sty for the Intermediate examination. | was not a bright\\n student in terms of examination grades but, thanks to my\\n two buddies back in Rameswaram, | had acquired a\\n practical bent of mind\\n \\n Whenever I returned to Rameswaram from Schwartz,\\n my elder brother Mustafa Kamal, who ran a provision store\\n ‘on the railway station road, would call me in to give him a\\n litle help and then vanish for hours together leaving the\\n \\x0cshop in my charge. | sold oil, onions, rice and everything\\n else. The fastest moving items, [found, were cigarettes and\\n bidis. | used to wonder what made poor people smoke\\n away their hardearned money. When spared by Mustafa, |\\n ‘would be put in charge of his kiosk by my younger brother,\\n Kasim Mohammed. There | sold novelies made of\\n seashells\\n \\n At St Joseph\\'s, | was lucky to find a teacher like the\\n Rey Father TN Sequeira. He taught us English and was\\n also our hostel warden. We were about a hundred boys\\n living in the three-storeyed hostel building. Rev. Father\\n used to visit each boy every night with a Bible in his hand\\n His energy and patience was amazing. He was a very\\n considerate person who took care of even the most minute\\n requirements of his students. On Deepavali, on his\\n instructions, the Brother in charge of the hostel and the\\n mess volunteers would visit each room and distribute good\\n gingelly oll for the ritual bath\\n \\n I stayed on the St. Joseph\\'s campus for four years and\\n shared my room with two others. One was an orthodox\\n lengar from Srirangam and the oher a Syrian Christian\\n from Kerala. The three of us had a wonderful time together.\\n When Iwas made secretary of the vegetarian mess during\\n my third year in the hostel, we invited the Rector, Rev,\\n Father Kalathil, over for lunch one Sunday. Our menu\\n included the choicest preparatons from our diverse\\n backgrounds. The result was rather unexpected, but Rev.\\n Father was lavish in his praise of our efforts. We enjoyed\\n every moment with Rev. Father Kalathil, who participated in\\n ‘our unsophisticated conversation with childlike enthusiasm,\\n Ihwas 2 memorable event for us all\\n \\n My teachers at St. Joseph were the tue followers of\\n Kanchi Paramacharya, who evoked people to “enjoy the\\n action of giving\". The vivid memory of our mathematics\\n teachers, Prof. Thothathr engar and Prof. Suryanarayana\\n Sastry, walking together on the campus inspires me to this\\n day.\\n ‘When Lwas in the final year at St Joseph\\'s, | acquired a\\n taste for English literature. | began to read the great\\n classics, Tolstoy, Scott and Hardy being special favourites\\n despite their exotic settings, and then | moved on to some:\\n works in Philosophy. It was around this time that |\\n developed a great interest in Physics.\\n \\n The lessons on subatomic physics at St Joseph\\'s by\\n my physics teachers, Prof. Chinna Durai and Prof.\\n Krishnamurthy, introduced me to the concept of the halflife\\n period and matters related to the radioactive decay of\\n substances. Sivasubramania lyer, my science teacher at\\n Rameswaram, had never taught me that most subatomic\\n particles are unstable and that they disintegrate after a\\n certain time into other particles. All this I was learning for\\n the first time. But when he taught me to strive with diligence\\n because decay is inherent in all compounded things, was\\n he not talking of the same thing? | wonder why some\\n people tend to see science as something which takes man\\n away from God. As I look at it, the path of science can\\n always wind through the heart Forme, science has always,\\n been the path to spiritual enrichment and setf-realisation\\n \\n Even the rational thought-matrices of science have\\n been home to fairy tales. 1am an avid reader of books on\\n cosmology and enjoy reading about celestial bodies. Many\\n fiends, while asking me questions related to space flights,\\n sometimes slip into astrology. Quite honestly, | have never\\n really understood the reason behind the great importance\\n altached by people to the faraway planets in our solar\\n system. As an art, [have nothing against astrology, but if it\\n \\x0cseeks acceptance under the guise of science, I reject it. 1\\n do not know how these myths evolved about planets, star\\n constellations, and even satelites—that they can exercise\\n powel beings. The tighly complicated\\n calculations manipulated around the precise movements of\\n celestial bodies, to derive highly subjective conclusions\\n appear illogical to me. As | see it, the Earth is the most\\n powerful and energetic planet. As John Milton puts it so\\n beautifully in Paradise Lost, Book VIE\\n \\n -.. What ifthe Sun\\n Be centre to the World, and other stars...\\n \\n The planet earth, so steadfast though she seem,\\n in sensibly three different motons move?\\n \\n ‘Wherever you go on this planet, there is movement and\\n life. Even apparently inanimate things like rocks, metal,\\n timber, clay are full of intrinsic movement—with electrons\\n dancing around each nucleus. This motion originates in\\n their response to the confinement imposed on them by the\\n nucleus, by means of electric forces which try to hold them\\n as close as possible. Electrons, just ike any individual with\\n a certain amount of energy, detest confinement The tighter\\n the electrons are held by the nucleus, the higher their orbital\\n velocity will be: in fact, the confinement of electrons in an\\n atom results in enormous velocities of about 1000 km per\\n second! These high velocities make the atom appear a\\n rigid sphere, just as a fast-moving fan appears like a disc. It\\n is very difficult to compress atoms more strongly—thus\\n giving matter its familiar solid aspect. Everything solid,\\n thus, contains much empty space within and everything\\n stationary contains great movement within. Itis as though\\n the great dance of Shiva is being performed on earth\\n during every moment of our existence.\\n \\n When I joined the B.Sc. degree course at StJoseph\\'s, |\\n was unaware of any other option for higher education. Nor\\n did | have any information about career opportunities,\\n available to a student of science. Only after obtaining a\\n BSc. did Irealise that physics was not my subject I had to\\n go into engineering to realise my dreams. | could have\\n joined the Engineering course long ago, right after finishing\\n my Intermediate course. Better late than never, [told myself\\n as I made the detour, appiying for admission into the\\n Madras Institute of Technology (MIT), regarded as the\\n crown jewel of technical education in South India at that\\n \\n Imanaged to be on the list of selected candidates, but\\n admission to this prestigious institution was an expensive\\n affair. Around a thousand rupees was required, and my\\n father could not spare that much money. At that time, my\\n sister, Zohara, stood behind me, mortgaging her gold\\n bangles and chain. | was deeply touched by her\\n determination to see me educated and by her faith in my\\n abilities. | vowed to release her bangles from mortgage\\n with my own earings. The only way before me to eam\\n money at that point of time was to study hard and get a\\n scholarship. Iwent ahead at full steam.\\n \\n What fascinated me most at MIT was the sight of two\\n decommissioned aircraft displayed there for the\\n demonstration of the various subsystems of fying\\n machines. | felt a strange attraction towards them, and\\n would sit near them long after other students had gone\\n back to the hostel, admiring man\\'s will to fly free in the sky\\n like a bird. After completing my first year, when I had to opt\\n for a specific branch, I almost spontaneously chose\\n aeronautical engineering. The goal was very clear in my\\n mind now, Iwas going to fly aircraft. Iwas convinced of this,\\n \\x0cdespite being aware of my lack of assertiveness, which\\n probably came about because of my humble background\\n Around this time, | made special efforts to ty and\\n communicate with different kinds of people.

Learning without wisdom is of no\\n use.\"\\n \\n h the course of my education at MIT, three teachers\\n shaped my thinking. Their combined contributions formed\\n the foundation on which I ater built my professional career.\\n These three teachers were Prof. Sponder, Prof KAV\\n Pandalai and Prof. Narasingha Rao. Each one of them had\\n very distinct personalities, but they shared a common\\n impulse— the capacity to feed their students’ intellectual\\n hunger by sheer briliance and untring zeal\\n \\n Prof. Sponder taught me technical aerodynamics. He\\n was an Austrian with rich practical experience in\\n aeronautical engineering. During the Second World War,\\n he had been captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in a\\n concentration camp. Understandably, he had developed a\\n very strong dislike for Germans. Inciden taly, the\\n aeronautical department was headed by a German, Prof.\\n Walter Repenthin. Another well-nown professor, Dr Kurt\\n Tank, was a distinguished aeronautical engineer who had\\n designed the German Focke-Wulf FW 190 single-seater\\n fighter plane, an outstanding combat aircraft of the Second\\n World War. Dr Tank later joined the Hindustan Aeronautics,\\n Limited (HAL) in Bangalore and was responsible for the\\n design of India\\'s first jet fighter, the HF-24 Marut.\\n \\n Notwithstanding these inrtants, Prof. Sponder\\n preserved his individuality and | maintained high\\n professional standards. He was always cai, energetic\\n and in total control of himself. He kept abreast of the latest\\n \\x0ctechnologies and expected his students to do the same. 1\\n consuited fim before opting for aeronautical engineering\\n He told me that one should never worry about one\\'s future\\n prospects: instead, it was more important to lay sound\\n foundations, to have sufficient enthusiasm and an\\n accompanying passion for one\\'s chosen field of study. The\\n ‘rouble with Indians, Prof. Sponder used to observe, was\\n not that they lacked educational opportunities or industial\\n infrastructure—the trouble was in their failure to\\n discriminate between disciplines and to rationalise their\\n choices. Why aeronautics? Why not electiical engineering?\\n Why not mechanical engineering? I myself would like to tell\\n all novitiate engineering students that when they choose\\n their specialization, the essential point to consider is\\n whether the choice articulates their inner feelings and\\n aspirations.\\n \\n Prof. KAV Pandalai taught me aero-structure design\\n and analysis. He was a cheerful, friendly and enthusiastic\\n teacher, who brought a fresh approach to every year\\'s\\n teaching course. twas Professor Pandalai who opened up\\n the secrets of structural engineering to us. Even today |\\n believe that everyone who has been taught by Prof.\\n Pandalai would agree that he was a man of great\\n intellectual integrity and scholarship—but with no trace of\\n arrogance. His students were free to disagree with him on\\n several points in the classroom\\n \\n Prof. Narasingha Rao was a mathematician, who taught\\n us theoretical aerodynamics. | stil remember his method of\\n teaching flid dynamics. After attending his classes, |\\n began to prefer mathematical physics to any other subject.\\n Often, | have been told | cany a ‘surgical knife” to\\n aeronautical design reviews. F it had not been for Prof.\\n Rao\\'s kind and persistent advice on picking up proofs to\\n equations of aerodynamic flow, | would not have acquired\\n this metaphorical tool\\n \\n Aeronautics is a fascinating subject, containing within it\\n the promise of freedom. The great difference between\\n freedom and escape, between motion and movement,\\n between slide and flow are the secrets of this science. My\\n teachers revealed these ths to me. Through their\\n meticulous teaching, they created within me an excitement\\n about aeronautics. Their intelectual fervour, clarity of\\n thought and passion for perfection helped me to launch into\\n a serious study of fluid dynamicsmodes of compressible\\n medium motion, development of shock waves and shock,\\n induced flow separation at increasing speeds, shock stall\\n and shock-wave dra\\n \\n Slowly, a great amalgamation of information took place\\n in my mind. The structural features of aeroplanes began to\\n gain new meanings— biplanes, monoplanes, tailless\\n planes, canard configured planes, deltawing planes, all\\n these began to assume increasing significance for me. The\\n three teachers, all of them authorites in their different fields,\\n helped me to mould a composite knowledge.\\n \\n My third and last year at MIT was a year of transition\\n and was to have a great impact on my later life. In those\\n days, a new climate of politcal enlightenment and industial\\n effort was sweeping across the country I had to test my\\n belief in God and see if it could fit into the matrix of\\n scientific thinking. The accepted wew was that a belief in\\n scientific methods was the only valid approach to\\n knowledge. if so, Iwondered, was matter alone the utimate\\n reality and were spiritual phenomena buta manifestation of\\n matter? Were all ethical values relative, and was sensory\\n perception the only source of knowledge and truth? |\\n wondered about these issues. attempting to sort out the\\n \\x0cvexing question of “scientific temper\" and my own spiritual\\n interests. The value system in which | had been nurtured\\n was profoundly religious. Ihad been taught that true reality\\n lay beyond the material world in the spiritual reaim, and that\\n knowledge could be obtained only through inner\\n experience.\\n \\n Meanwhile, when I had finished my course work, I was\\n assigned a project to design a low-level attack aircraft\\n together with four other colleagues. | had taken up the\\n responsibility of preparing and drawing the aerodynamic\\n design. My team mates distibuted among themselves the\\n tasks of designing the propulsion, structure, control and\\n instrumentation of the aircraft One day, my design teacher,\\n Prof. Srinivasan, then the Director of the MIT, reviewed my\\n progress and declared it dismal and disappointing. |\\n offered a dozen excuses for the delay, but none of them\\n impressed Prof. Srinivasan. | finally pleaded for a month\\'s,\\n time to complete the task. The Professor looked at me for\\n some time and said, ‘Look, young man, today is Friday\\n afternoon. Igive you three days\\' time. fy Monday moming\\n Idor\\'t get the configuration drawing, your scholarship will\\n be stopped.\" | was dumbstuck. The scholarship was my\\n lifeline and I would be quite helpless if it was withdrawn. |\\n could see no other way out but to finish the task as I had\\n been instucted. That night, | remained at the drawing\\n board, skipping dinner. Next moming, | took only an hour\\'s\\n break to freshen up and eat a litle food. On Sunday\\n moming, Iwas very near completion, when suddenly I felt\\n someone else\\'s presence in the room. Prof. Srinivasan\\n ‘was watching me from a distance. Coming straight from the\\n gymkhana, he was still in his tennis outfit and had dropped\\n in to see my progress. After examining my work, Prof,\\n Srinivasan hugged me affectionately and patted my back in\\n appreciation. He said, ‘I knew | was putting you under\\n stess and asking you to meet an impossible deadline, |\\n never expected you to perform so well\\n \\n During the rest of the period of the project, | participated\\n in an essay competition organized by the MIT Tamil\\n Sangam (Literary Society). Tamil is my mother tongue and |\\n am proud of its origins, which have been traced back to\\n Sage Agastya in the pre-Ramayana period: its literature\\n dates back to the fifth century BC. itis said to be a\\n language moulded by lawyers and grammarians and is,\\n internationally acclaimed for its clear-cut logic. | was very\\n enthusiastic about ensuring that science did not remain\\n outside the purview of this wonderful language. Iwrote an\\n article entitled *Let Us Make Our Own Aircraft’ in Tamil. The\\n article evoked much interest and | won the competition,\\n taking the first prize from ‘Devan’, the editor of the popular\\n Tamil weekly, Ananda Vikatan\\n \\n My most touching memory of MIT is related to Prof.\\n Sponder. We were posing for a group photograph as part\\n of a farewell ritual, All the graduating students had lined up\\n in three rows with the professors seated in the front\\n Suddenly, Prof. Sponder got up and looked for me. I was\\n standing in the third row. “Come and sit with me in the\\n front,” he said. I was taken aback by Prof, Sponder\\'s\\n invtaton “You are my best student and hard work will help\\n \\n bring a great name for your teachers in future.\"\\n Embarassed “by the praise but honoured by the\\n recognition, | sat with Prof. Sponder for the photograph,\\n ‘Let God be your hope, your stay, your guide and provide\\n the lantem for your feet in your journey into the future,\" said\\n the introverted gerius, bidding me adieu.\\n \\n m MIT, I went to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited\\n \\x0c(HAL) at Bangalore as a trainee. There I worked on engine\\n overhauling as part of a team. Hands-on work on aircraft\\n engine overhauling was very educative. When a principle\\n leamtin the classrooms bome out by practical experience,\\n it creates a strange sense of excitement—akin\\n unexpectedly running into an old friend among a crowd of\\n strangers. At HAL, | worked on the overhauling of both\\n piston and turbine engines. The hazy concepts of gas\\n dynamics and diffusion processes in the working principle\\n of after burring came into sharper focus in my mind. | was\\n also trained in radial engine-cum-drum operations.\\n \\n Teamed how to check a crankshaft for wear and tear,\\n and a connecting rod and crankshaft for twist. I did\\n calibrations of a fixedpitch fan fitted to a supercharged\\n engine. lopened up pressure and acceleration-cum-speed\\n contral systems, and air starter supply systems of turbo-\\n engines. Getting to understand feathering, un-feathering\\n and reversing of propeller engines was very interesting\\n The demonstration of the delicate art of beta (blade angle\\n control} by HAL technicians stil lingers in my memory. They\\n had neither studied in major universities, nor were they\\n merely implementing what their engineer-in-charge was\\n suggesting. They had been working hands-on for years and\\n this had given them something like an intuitive feel for the\\n \\n work.\\n \\n Two altemative opportunities for employment, both\\n close to my longstanding dream of flying, presented\\n themselves before me when | came out of HAL as a\\n graduate aeronautical engineer. One was a career in the\\n Air Force and another was a job at the Directorate of\\n Technical Development and Production, DTD&P*(Air), at\\n the Ministry of Defence. | applied for both. The interview\\n calls arrived from both the places almost simultaneously. |\\n was asked to reach Dehra Dun by the Air Force\\n recruitment authorities and Delhi by DTD&P(Air). The boy\\n from the Coromandel Coast took a train to the North of\\n dia. My destination was more than 2000 km away, and\\n was to be my first encounter with the vastness of my\\n motherland.\\n \\x0c3\\n \\n t\\n \\n trough the window of the compartment, I watched the\\n countyside slip past. From a distance, the men inthe fields\\n in their white dhotis and turbans, and the womenfolk in\\n bright\\n \\n splashes of colour against the green background of\\n paddy fields, seemed to inhabit some beautiful painting. |\\n sat glued to the window. Almost everywhere, people were\\n engaged in some activity which had a rhythm and\\n tranquility about it_men driving cattle, women fetching\\n water from streams. Occasionally, a child would appear\\n and wave at the train.\\n \\n is astonishing how the landscape changes as one\\n moves northwards. The rich and fertile plains of the river\\n Ganga and its numerous tributaries have invited invasion,\\n turmoil, and change. Around 1500 BC, fair-skinned Aryans\\n swept in through the mountain passes from the far north-\\n west. The tenth century brought Musiims, who later mingled\\n with the local people and became an integral part of this\\n county. One empire gave way to another. Religious\\n conquests continued. All this time, the part of India south of\\n the Tropic of Cancer remained largely untouched, safe\\n behind the shield of the Vindhya and Satpura mountain\\n ranges. The Narmada, Tapti, Mahanadi, Godavari, and\\n Krishna rivers had woven a net of almost unassailable\\n protection for the tapering Indian peninsula. To bring me to\\n Delhi, my tain had crossed all these geographical\\n impediments through the power of scientific advancement.\\n \\n Thalted for a week in Delhi, the city of the great Sufi\\n Saint Hazrat Nizamuddin, and appeared for the interview at\\n DTD&P{Air), I did well at the interview. The questions were\\n of a routine nature, and did not challenge my knowledge of\\n the subject. Then | proceeded to Dehra Dun for my\\n interview at the Air Force Selection Board. At the Selection\\n Board, the emphasis was more on ‘personality’ than on\\n intelligence. Pethaps they were looking for physical fitness,\\n and an arficulate manner. | was excited but nervous,\\n determined but anxious, confident but tense. | could only\\n finish ninth in the batch of 25 examined to select eight\\n officers for commissioning in the Air Force. Iwas deeply\\n disappointed. Ittook me some time to comprehend that the\\n opportunity to join the Air Force had just siipped through my\\n fingers. | dragged myself out of the Selection Board and\\n stood at the edge of a cliff.

No more did I feel\\n any bittemess or resentment at my failure to enter the Air\\n Force. All this was in 1958.\\n \\n Atthe Directorate, Iwas posted at the Technical Centre\\n (Civil Aviation). If lwas not flying aeroplanes, I was at least\\n helping to make them ainworthy. During my frst year in the\\n Directorate, | carried out a design assignment on\\n supersonic target aircraft with the help of the officerin-\\n charge, R Varadharajan, and won a word of praise from the\\n Director, Dr Neelakantan. To gain shop-foor exposure to\\n aircraft _ maintenance, | was sent to the Aircraft and\\n Armament Testing Unit (A&ATU) at Kanpur. At that time,\\n they were involved in a topical evaluation of Gnat Mk I\\n aircraft. | participated in the performance assessment of its,\\n ‘operation systems.\\n \\n Even in those days, Kanpur was a very populous city. it\\n was my first experience of living in an industrial town. The\\n cold weather, crowds, noise and smoke were in total\\n contrast to what | was used to in Rameswaram. | was\\n particularly troubled by the ubiquitous presence of potatoes\\n ‘onthe dining table, right from breakfast to dinner. To me, it\\n seemed that a feeling of loneliness pervaded the city. The\\n people on the streets had all come from their vilages in\\n Search of jobs in factories, leaving behind the smell of their\\n soil and the protection of their families.\\n \\n ‘On my return to Delhi, Iwas informed that the design of\\n a DART target had been taken up at the DTD&P (Air) and\\n that I had been included in the design team. | completed\\n this task with the other team members. Then, I undertook a\\n preliminary design study on a Human Centrifuge. | later\\n caried out the design and development of a Vertical\\n Takeoff and Landing Platform. | was also associated with\\n the development and construction of the Hot Cockpit. Three\\n years passed. Then the Aeronautical Development\\n Establishment (ADE) was bom in Bangalore and | was\\n posted to the new establishment.\\n \\x0cBangalore as a city was in direct contrast to Kanpur. h\\n fact, [feel our country has an uncanny way of bringing out\\n extremes in her people. | suppose, it is because Indians\\n have been both afflicted and enriched by centuries of\\n migrations. Loyalty to different rulers has dulled our\\n capacity for a single allegiance. Instead, we have\\n developed an extraordinary ability to be compassionate\\n and cruel, sensitive and callous, deep and fickle, all at the\\n same time. To the untrained eye, we may appear colourful\\n and picturesque; fo the critical eye, we are but shoddy\\n imitations of our various masters. h Kanpur, | saw paan-\\n chewing imitations of Wajid Ali Shah, and in Bangalore it\\n was replaced by dog-walking sahibs. Here too, longed for\\n the depth and calmness of Rameswaram. The relationship\\n between the heart and the head of an earthy Indian has\\n been eroded by the divided sensibilities of our cites. |\\n spent my evenings exploring the gardens and shopping\\n plazas of Bangalore.\\n \\n The workload at ADE during the first year of its\\n inception was quite light. Infact, | had to generate work for\\n myself at first, until the tempo gradually built up. Based on\\n my preliminary studies on ground-handling equipment, a\\n project team was formed to design and develop an\\n indigenous hovercraft prototype as a ground equipment\\n mactine (GEM), The team was a small working group,\\n comprising four persons at the level of Scientific Assistant\\n Dr OP Mediratta, Director of the ADE, asked me to lead\\n the team. We were given three years to launch the\\n engineering model\\n \\n ject was, by any standards, bigger than our\\n collective capabilities. None of us had any experience in\\n building @ machine, let alone a fying machine. There were\\n no designs or standard components available to begin\\n with, All we knew was that we had to make a successful\\n heavier-than-air fying machine. We tried to read as much\\n literature as we could find on hovercrafts, but there was not\\n much available. We tied to consult people knowledgeable\\n in this area, but could find none. One day, I simply took the\\n decision to proceed with the limited information and\\n resources available.\\n \\n This endeavour to produce a wingless, light, swift\\n machine opened the windows of my mind. Iwas quick to\\n see at least a metaphorical connection between a\\n hovercraft and an aircraft. After al, the Wright Brothers\\n made the first aeroplane after fixing bicycles for seven\\n years! I saw in the GEM project great opportunities for\\n ingenuity and growth. We went straight into hardware\\n development after spending a few months on the drawing\\n board\\n \\n ‘There is always the danger that a person with my kind of\\n background— rural or smalktown, middle-class, whose\\n parents had limited education— will retreat into a corer\\n and remain there stugging for bare existence, unless\\n some great tum of circumstance propels him into a more\\n favourable environment. I knew I had to create my own\\n ‘opportunities.\\n \\n Part by part, subsystem by subsystem, stage by stage,\\n things started moving. Working on this project, | learned\\n that once your mind stretches to a new level it never goes.\\n back to its original dimension.\\n \\n At that time VK Krishna Menon was the Defence\\n Minister. He was keenly interested in the progress of our\\n small project, which he envisioned as the beginning of the\\n indigenous development of India\\'s defence equipment\\n Whenever he was in Bangalore, he always found some\\n \\x0c‘time to review the progress of our project His confidence in\\n ‘our ability ignited our enthusiasm. | would enter the\\n assembly shop leaving my other problems outside, just as\\n my father used to enter the mosque for prayer, leaving his\\n shoes outside.\\n \\n But not everyone accepted Krishna Menon\\'s opinion\\n about GEM. Our experiments with the available parts and\\n components did not exactly delight my senior colleagues.\\n Many even called us a group of eccenttic inventors in\\n pursuit of an impossible dream. |, being the leader of the\\n ‘nawies’, was a particularly inviting target. Iwas regarded\\n as yet another country bumpkin who believed that riding the\\n air was his domain. The weight of opinion against us\\n buttressed my ever-optimistic mind. The comments of\\n some of the senior scientists at ADE made me recall John\\n Trowbridge\\'s famous satirical poem on the Wright\\n Brothers, published in 1896:\\n \\n wih thimble and thread\\n And vax and hammer, and buckles and screws,\\n \\n And alf such things as geniuses use; —\\n Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!\\n A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellovs.\\n \\n When the project was about a year old, Defence\\n Minister Krishna Menon made one of his routine visits to\\n ADE. | escorted him into our assembly shop. Inside, on a\\n table lay the GEM model broken down into. sub\\n assemblies. The model represented the culmination of one:\\n year\\'s untiring efforts to develop a practical hovercraft for\\n battlefield applications. The minister fired one question\\n after another at me, determined to ensure that the prototype\\n would go into test fight within the coming year. He told Dr\\n Mediratta, “GEM fight is possible with the gadgets Kalam\\n now possesses\"\\n \\n The hovercraft was christened Nandi, after the bull\\n ridden by Lord Shiva. For a prototype, its form, fitand finish\\n \\n beyond our expectation, given the rudimentary\\n infrastructure we possessed. I told my colleagues, “Here is,\\n a fying machine, not constructed by a bunch of cranks but\\n by engineers of ability, Don\\'t look at itit is not made to\\n look at, butto fy with.”\\n \\n Defence Minister Krishna Menon flew in the Nandi,\\n overruling the accompanying officials’ concer for his,\\n safety. A Group Captain in the minister\\'s toupe, who had\\n logged in many thousands of flying hours, even offered to fly\\n the machine to save the minister from the potential danger\\n of flying with an inexperienced civilian pilot ike myself and\\n gestured to me to come out of the machine. | was sure\\n about my competence in fying the machine I had made,\\n and therefore shook my head in negation. Observing this,\\n wordless communication, Krishna Menon dismissed the\\n insulting suggestion of the Group Captain with a laugh and\\n signalled to me to start the machine. He was very happy.\\n \\n u have demonstrated that the basic problems of\\n hovercraft development are solved. Go for a more powerful\\n prime mover and call me for a second ride,\" Krishna Menon\\n fold me. The skeptical Group Captain (now Air Marshal)\\n Golay, later became a good friend of mine.\\n \\n We completed the project ahead of schedule. We had a\\n working hovercraft with us, moving on an air cushion of\\n about 40mm with a load of S50kg, including the tare weight,\\n Dr Mediratta was visibly pleased with the achievement. But\\n by this time, Krishna Menon was out of office and could not\\n take his promised second ride. In the new order, not many\\n people shared his dream wih regard to military\\n applications of an indigenous hovercraft h fact, even\\n \\x0ctoday, we import hovercrafts. The project was mired in\\n controversies and was finally shelved. it was a new\\n experience for me. So far, I had believed that the sky was\\n the limit, but now it appeared that the limits were much\\n closer. There are boundaries that dictate life: you can only\\n lift so much weight, you can only leam so fast; you can only\\n ‘work so hard: you can only go so fart\\n \\n Iwas unwiling to face reality. Ihad put my heart and soul\\n into Nandi. That it would not be used was something\\n beyond my comprehension. | was disappointed and\\n disillusioned. In this period of confusion and uncertainty\\n memories from my childhood came back to me and |\\n discovered new meanings in them,\\n \\n Pakshi Sastry used to say, “Seek the truth, and the truth\\n shall set you free.\" As the Bible says, \"Ask and you shall\\n receive.” It did not happen immediately, but it happened\\n nevertheless. One day, Dr Mediratta called me. He inquired\\n about the state of our hovercraft. When told that it was in\\n perfect condition to be flown, he asked me to organize a\\n demonstration for an important visitor the next day. No VIP\\n was scheduled to visit the laboratory during the next week\\n as far as I knew. However, communicated Dr Mediratta\\'s\\n instructions to my colleagues and we felt a new surge of\\n ho}\\n \\n pe.\\n \\n The next day Dr Mediratta brought a visitor to our\\n hovercraft—a tal, handsome, bearded man. He asked me\\n several questions about the machine. Iwas struck by the\\n objectivity and clarity of his thinking. “Can you give me a\\n ride in the mackine?\" he enquired. His request filed me\\n vith joy. Finally, here was someone who was interested in\\n \\n We took a ten-minute ride in the hovercraft, a few\\n centimetres above the ground. We were not fying, but were\\n definitely floating in the air The visitor asked me a few\\n questions about myself, thanked me for the ride and\\n departed. But not before introducing hirnself—he was Prof.\\n MGK Menon, Director of the Tata Institute of Fundamental\\n Research (TFR). After a week, I received a call from the\\n hdian Committee for Space Research (NCOSPAR), to\\n altend an interview for the post of Rocket Engineer. All |\\n knew about NCOSPAR at that time was that it was fomed\\n out of the TIFR talent pool at Bombay (now Mumbai) to\\n organize space research in hdia.\\n \\n Iwent to Bombay to attend the interview. I was unsure\\n about the type of questions | would have to face at the\\n interview. There was hardly any time to read up or talk to\\n any eyperienced person. Lakshmana Sasty\\'s vice\\n quoting from the Bhagawad Gita echoed in my ears:\\n \\n All beings are born to delusion .. . overcome by the\\n duatites which arise fom wish and hate... . But those\\n men of virtuous deeds in whom sin has come to an end,\\n freed from the delusion of dualities, worship Me steadiast\\n in their vows.\\n \\n Treminded myself that the best way to win was to not\\n need to win. The best performances are accomplished\\n when you are relaxed and free of doubt. | decided to take\\n things as they came. Since neither Prof. MGK Menon\\'s visit\\n nor the call for an interview had been of my making, |\\n decided this was the best attitude to take.\\n \\n Iwas interviewed by Dr Vikram Sarabhai along with\\n Prof. MGK Menon and Mr Saraf, then the Deputy Secretary\\n of the Atomic Energy Commission. As lentered the room, |\\n sensed their warmth and friendliness. | was almost\\n immediately struck by Dr Sarabhai\\'s warmth, There was\\n none of the arrogance or the patronising attitudes which\\n \\x0cinterMewers usually display when talking to a young and\\n winerable candidate. Dr Sarabhai\\'s questions did not\\n probe my existing knowledge or skills; rather they were an\\n exploration of the possibilities | was filed with. He was\\n \\n ing at me as ifin reference to a larger whole. The entire\\n encounter seemed to me a total moment of truth, in which\\n my dream was enveloped hy the larger dream of a bigger\\n person.\\n \\n Iwas advised to stay back for a couple of days.\\n However, the next evening Iwas told about my selection. |\\n was to be absorbed as a rocket engineer at INCOSPAR.\\n This was a breakthrough a young man like myself dreamed\\n of\\n \\n My work at INCOSPAR commenced with a\\n familiarization course at the TIFR Computer Centre. The\\n atmosphere here was remarkably different from that at\\n DTD&P (AR). Labels mattered very little. There was no\\n need for anyone to justify his position or to be at the\\n receiving end of the others’ hostility.\\n \\n Some tme in the latter half of 1962, INCOSPAR took\\n the decision to set up the Equatorial Rocket Launching\\n Station at Thumba, a sleepy fishing village near Trivandrum\\n (now Thiruvananthapuram) in Kerala. Dr Chithis of the\\n Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad had spotted it\\n a8 a suitable location as it was very close to the earth\\'s,\\n magnetic equator. This was the quiet beginning of modem\\n rocket-based research in India. The site selected at\\n Thumba lay between the railway line and the sea coast,\\n covering a distance of about two and a half km and\\n measuring about 600 acres. Within this area, stood a large\\n church, whose site had to be acquired. Land acquisiton\\n from private parties is always a difficut and tme-\\n consuming process, especially in densely populated places\\n like Kerala. In addition, there was the delicate matter of\\n acquiring a site of religious significance. The Collector of\\n Trivandrum then, K Madhavan Nair, executed this task in a\\n most tactful, peaceful and expeditious manner, with the\\n blessings and cooperation of Right Rew. Dr Dereira, who\\n was the Bishop of Trivandrum in 1962. Soon RD John, the\\n executive engineer of the Central Public Works Department\\n (CPD), had transformed the entire area. The St. Mary\\n Magdalene church housed the first office of the Thumba\\n Space Centre. The prayer room was my first laboratory, the\\n Bishop\\'s room was my design and drawing office. To this\\n day, the church is maintained in its full glory and, at present,\\n houses the Indian Space Museum,\\n \\n Very soon after this, Iwas asked to proceed to America\\n for a sixmonth taining programme on sounding rocket\\n launching techniques, at the National Aeronautics and\\n Space Administration (NASA) work centres. | took some\\n time off before going abroad and went to Rameswaram,\\n My father was very pleased to leam about the opportunity\\n that had come my way. He took me to the mosque and\\n organized a special namaz in thanksgiving. I could feel the\\n power of God flowing in a circuit through my father to me\\n and back to God; we were all under the spell of the prayer.\\n \\n One of the important functions of prayer, | believe, is to\\n act as a stimulus to creative ideas. Within the mind are all\\n the resources required for successful iving. Weas are\\n present in the consciousness, which when released and\\n given scope to grow and take shape, can lead to\\n successful events. God, our Creator, has stored within our\\n minds and personalities, great potential strength and\\n ability. Prayer helps us to tap and develop these powers.\\n \\n Ahmed Jallaluddin and Samsuddin came to see me off\\n at Bombay airport. It was their first exposure to a big city\\n \\x0clike Bombay, just as | myself was about to have my first\\n exposure to a mega city like New York. Jallaluddin and\\n Samsuddin were selfreliant, positive, optimistic men who\\n undertook their work with the assurance of success. It is,\\n from these two persons that I drew the core creative power\\n of my mind. My sentiments could not he contained, and |\\n could feel the mist of tears in my eyes. Then, Jallaluddin\\n said, “Azad, we have always loved you, and we believe in\\n you. We shall ahvays be proud of you\". The intensity and\\n purity of their faith in my capabilities broke my last\\n defences, and tears welled up in my eyes.\\n \\x0c\\x0cCREATION\\n \\n [1963 - 1980 ]\\n \\x0c\\x0cAchievers\\n \\n started my work at NASA at the Langley Research\\n Centre (LRC) in Hampton, Virginia. This is primarily an\\n R&D centre for advanced aerospace technology. One of\\n my most vivid memories\\n \\n of LRC is of a piece of sculpture depicting a charioteer\\n driving two horses, one representing scientific research\\n and the other technological development, metaphorically\\n encapsulating the interconnection between research and\\n development.\\n \\n From LRC I went to the Goddard Space Flight Centre\\n (GSFC) at Greenbelt, Maryland. This Centre develops and\\n manages most of NASA\\'s earth-orbiting science and\\n applications satelites. It operates NASA\\'s tracking\\n networks for all space missions. Towards the end of my\\n Visit, lwentto the Wallops Flight Facility at Wallops Island in\\n East Coast, Virginia. This place was the base for NASA\\'s\\n sounding rocket programme. Here, | saw a painting\\n prominently displayed in the reception lobby. I depicted a\\n battle scene with a few rockets flying in the background. A.\\n painting with this theme should be the most commonplace\\n thing at a Flight Facility, but the painting caught my eye\\n because the soldiers on the side launching the rockets\\n ‘were not white, but dark-skinned, with the racial features of\\n people found in South Asia. One day, my curiosity got the\\n better of me, drawing me towards the painting. Ittumed out\\n to be Tipu Sultan\\'s any fighting the British. The painting\\n depicted a fact forgotten in Tipu\\'s own country but\\n commemorated here on the other side of the planet. I was\\n happy to see an Indian glorified by NASA as a hero of\\n warfare rocket.\\n \\n My impression of the American people can be\\n summarized by @ quotation from Benjamin Franklin, “Those\\n things that hurtinstruct\" I realised that people in this part of\\n the world meet their problems head on. They attempt to get\\n outof them rather than suffer them,\\n \\n My mother had once narrated an incident from the Holy\\n Book— after God created man, he asked the angels to\\n prostrate themselves before Adam. Everybody prostrated\\n themselves except Iblis, or Satan, who refused. “Why did\\n you not prostrate yourself?\" Allah asked. “You created me\\n of fire and him of clay. Does not that make me nobler than\\n Adam?\" Satan contended. God said, ‘Be gone from\\n paradise! This is no place for your contemptuous pride.\"\\n Satan obeyed, but not before cursing Adam with the same\\n fate. Soon Adam followed suit by becoming a transgressor\\n after eating the forbidden fruit. Allah said, “Go hence and\\n may your descendants live a life of doubt and mistrust.\"\\n \\n ‘What makes life in Indian organizations difficut is the\\n widespread prevalence of this very contemptuous pride. tt\\n stops us from listening to our juniors, subordinates and\\n people down the line. You cannot expect a person to deliver\\n results if you humiliate him, nor can you expect him to be\\n creative if you abuse him or despise him. The line between\\n fimmness and harshness, between strong leadership and\\n bullying, between discipline and vindictiveness is very fine,\\n but it-has to be drawn. Unfortunately, the only line\\n prominently drawn in our country today is between the\\n ‘heroes’ and the ‘zeros’. On one side are a few hundred\\n ‘heroes’ keeping nine hundred and fifty milion people down\\n on the other side. This situation has to be changed.\\n \\n As the process of confronting and solving problems\\n ‘often requires hard work and is painful, we have endless.\\n \\x0cprocrastination. Actually, problems can be the cutting edge\\n that actually distinguish between success and failure. They\\n drawoutinnate courage and wisdom,\\n \\n As soon as | retumed from NASA, India\\'s first rocket\\n launch took place on 21 November 1963. Itwas a sounding\\n rocket, called NikeApache, made at NASA. The rocketwas\\n assembled in the church building I have referred to earlier.\\n ‘The only equipment available to transport the rocket was a\\n truck and a manually operated hydraulic crane. The\\n assembled rocket was to be shifted from the church\\n building to the launch pad by truck. When the rocket was\\n lifted by the crane and was about to be placed on the\\n launcher, it started titing, indicating a leak in the hydraulic\\n system of the crane. As we were fast approaching the\\n launch tme, 6 p.m. any repairs to the crane had to be ruled\\n out. Fortunately, the leak was not large and we managed to\\n lift the rocket manually, using our collective muscle power\\n and finally placing iton the launcher.\\n \\n h the maiden Nike-Apache launch, I was in charge of\\n rocket integration and safety. Two of my colleagues who\\n played a very active and crucial role in this launch were D\\n Easwardas and R Aravamudan. Easwardas undertook the\\n rocket assembly and arranged the launch. Aravamudan,\\n whom we called Dan, was in charge of radar, telemetry and\\n ground support. The launch was smooth and problemfree.\\n We obtained excellent fight data and retumed with a sense\\n ofpride and accomplishment.\\n \\n ‘When we were relaxing the next evening at the dinner\\n table, we received news of the assassination of President\\n John F Kennedy in Dallas, Texas. We were appalled. The\\n Kemnedy years were a significant era in America, when\\n young men were at the helm of affairs. used to read with\\n interest about Kennedy\\'s moves in the missile crisis of late\\n 1962. The Soviet Union built missile sites in Cuba, from\\n which it would have been possible to launch attacks on\\n American cities. Kennedy imposed a blockade or\\n ‘quarantine’, barring the introduction of any offensive\\n missiles to Cuba. America also threatened to respond to\\n any Soviet nuclear attack from Cuba on any country in the\\n Westem Hemisphere by retaliating against the USSR. After\\n fourteen days of intense drama, the crisis was resolved by\\n the Sovet Premier Khrushchev ordering that the Cuban\\n bases be dismantled and the missiles returned to Russia.\\n \\n ‘The next day, Prof. Sarabhai had a detailed discussion\\n vith us on future plans. He was creating @ new frontier in\\n the field of science and technology in India. A new\\n generation, scientists and engineers in their 30s and early\\n 40s, was being charged with an unprecedented dynamism,\\n Our biggest qualifications at INCOSPAR were not our\\n degrees and training, but Prof. Sarabhai\\'s faith in our\\n capabilities. After the successful launch of Nike-Apache, he\\n \\n hose to share with us his dream of an Indian Satelite\\n Launch Vehicle\\n \\n Prof. Sarabhai\\'s optimism was highly contagious. The\\n very news of his coming to Thumba would electify people\\n and all laboratories, workshops and design offices would\\n hum with unceasing activity. People would work virtually\\n round the clock because of their enthusiasm to show Prof.\\n Sarabhai something new, something that had not been\\n done before in our county—be it a new design or a new\\n method of fabrication or even an outofthe-way\\n administrative procedure. Prof. Sarabhai would often\\n assign multiple tasks to a single person or a group. Though\\n some of those tasks would appear totally unrelated in the\\n beginning, they would, at a later stage, emerge as deeply\\n interconnected. When Prof. Sarabhai was talking to us\\n \\x0cabout the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV}, he asked me,\\n almost in the same breath, to take up studies on a\\n rocketassisted take-off system (RATO) for military aircraft\\n The two things had no apparent connection except in the\\n mnind of this great visionary. Iknew that all [had to dowas to\\n remain alert and focussed on my purpose, and sooner or\\n later, an opportunity to do a challenging job would enter my\\n laboratory.\\n \\n arabhai was ever-wiling to ty out novel\\n approaches and liked to drawin young people. He had the\\n wisdom and judgement which enabled him to realise not\\n only if something was well done, but also when it was time\\n to stop. In my opinion, he was an ideal experimenter and\\n innovator, When there were altemative courses of action\\n before us, whose outcome was difficut to predict, or to\\n reconcile varying perspectives, Prof. Sarabhai would resort\\n to experimentation to resolve the issue. This was precisely\\n the situation at INCOSPAR in 1963. A bunch of young,\\n inexperienced, but nevertheless energetic and enthusiastic\\n persons were given the task of fleshing out the spirit of\\n selfreliance in the field of science and technology in\\n general, and of space research in particular. Itwas a great\\n example of leadership by trust.\\n \\n ‘The rocket launch site later blossomed into the Thumba\\n Equatorial Rocket Launch Station (TERLS). TERLS was\\n established through active collaboration with France, USA\\n and USSR. The leader of the Indian space programme—\\n Prof. Vikram Sarabhai—had comprehended the ful\\n implications of the challenge and had not balked at taking it\\n ‘on. Right from the day INCOSPAR was formed, he was\\n aware of the need to organize an integrated national space\\n programme, with the equipment for the manufacture of\\n rockets and launch facilities developed and produced\\n indigenously.\\n \\n With this in wew, @ wide-ranging programme for\\n scientific and technological development in rocket fuels,\\n propulsion systems, aeronautics, aerospace materials,\\n advanced fabrication techniques, rocket motor\\n instrumentation, control and guidance systems, telemetry,\\n tracking systems and scientific instuments for\\n experimentation in space were launched at the Space\\n Science and Technology Centre and the Physical\\n Research Laboratory at Ahmedabad. Incidentally, this\\n laboratory has produced a large number of Indian space\\n scientists of extremely high calibre over the years.\\n \\n The real journey of the Indian aerospace programme,\\n however, had begun with the Rohini Sounding Rocket\\n (RSR) Programme. Whatis it that distinguishes a sounding\\n rocket from a Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and from a\\n missile? In fact, they are three different kinds of rackets.\\n Sounding rockets are normally used for probing the near-\\n earth environment, including the upper regions of the\\n atmosphere. While they can carry a variety of scientific\\n payloads to a range of altitudes, they cannot impart the final\\n velocity needed to orbit the payload. On the other hand, a\\n launch vehicle is designed to inject into orbit a\\n technological payload or satelite. The final stage of a\\n launch vehicle provides the necessary velocity for a satelite\\n to enter an orbit. This is a complex operation requiring on-\\n board guidance and control systems. A missile, though\\n belonging to the same family, is a still more complex\\n system. In addition to the large terminal velocity and\\n onboard guidance and contro, it must have the capability to\\n home onto targets. When the targets are fast-moving and\\n capable of manoeuvring, a missile is also required to carry\\n \\x0cout targettracking functions.\\n \\n The RSR programme was responsible for the\\n development and fabrication of sounding rockets and their\\n associated on-board systems for scientific investigations in\\n India. Under this programme, a family of operational\\n sounding rockets were developed. These rockets had wide\\n ranging capabilities, and to date several hundreds of these\\n rockets have been launched for various scientific and\\n technological studies.\\n \\n Istil remember that the first Rohini rocket consisted of a\\n single solid propulsion motor weighing a mere 32 kg. It\\n lifted a nominal 7 kg payload to an altitude of about 10 km.\\n Iwas soon followed by another, to which one more solid\\n propellant stage was added to dispatch muiti-experiment\\n payloads weighing nearly 100 kg to an altitude of over 350\\n \\n km,\\n \\n The development of these rockets had resulted ina fully\\n indigenous capability in the production of sounding rockets,\\n as well as their propellants. This programme had brought\\n into the county technology for the production of very high-\\n performance solid propellants, like those based on\\n polyurethane and polybutane polymer. It later resulted in the\\n setting up of a Propellant Fuel Complex (PFC) to\\n manufacture strategic chemicals required for rocket\\n engines, and a Rocket Propellant Plant (RPP) to produce\\n propellants.\\n \\n The development of Indian rockets in the twentieth\\n century can be seen as a revival of the eighteenth century\\n dream of Tipu Sultan. When Tipu Sultan was killed, the\\n British captured more than 700 rockets and subsystems of\\n 900 rockets in the batte of Turukhanahally in 1799. His\\n amy had 27 brigades, called Kushoons, and each brigade\\n had a company of rocket men, called Jourks. These\\n rockets had been taken to England by Wiliam Congreve\\n and were subjected by the British to what we call ‘reverse\\n engineering’ today. There were, of course, no GATT, IPR\\n Act, or patent regime. With the death of Tipu, Indian\\n rocketry also metits demise—at least for 150 years.\\n \\n Meanwhile, rocket technology made great strides\\n abroad. Konstantin Tsiolkovsky in Russia (1903), Robert\\n Goddard in USA (1914) and Hermann Oberth in Germany\\n (1923) gave rocketry new dimensions. In Nazi Germany,\\n Wemher von Braun\\'s group produced V-2 short range\\n ballistic missiles and showered fire on the Allied Forces.\\n After the war, both the USA and the USSR captured their\\n share of German rocket technology and rocket engineers.\\n With this booty, they started to run their deadly arms race\\n vith missiles and warheads.\\n \\n Rocketry was rebom in India thanks to the technological\\n vision of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, Prof. Sarabhai\\n took the challenge of giving physical dimensions to this\\n dream. Very many individuals with myopic vision\\n questioned the relevance of space activites in a newly\\n independent nation which was finding it difficult to feed its,\\n population. But neither Prime Minister Nehru nor Prof.\\n Sarabhai had any ambiguity of purpose. Their vision was\\n very clear: if Indians were to play a meaningful role in the\\n community of nations, they must be second to none in the\\n application of advanced technologies to their realife\\n problems. They had no intention of using it merely as a\\n means to display our might.\\n \\x0c\\x0cDreamers\\n \\n D\\n \\n uring his frequent visits to Thumba, Prof, Sarabhai\\n would openly review the progress of work with the entire\\n team. He never gave directions. Rather, through a free\\n exchange\\n \\n of views, he led us forward into new terrain which often\\n revealed an unforeseen solution. Perhaps he was aware\\n that though a particular goal might be clear to himself, and\\n he could give adequate directions for its accomplishment,\\n his team members might have resisted working towards a\\n goal that made no sense to them. He considered the\\n collective understanding of the problem the main attribute\\n of effective leadership. He once told me, \"Look, my job is to\\n make decisions; butit is equaly important to see to it that\\n these decisions are accepted by my team members.\"\\n \\n h fact, Prof. Sarabhai took a series of decisions that\\n were to become the life-mission of many. We would make\\n ‘our own rockets, our own Satelite Launch Vehicles (SLVs)\\n and our own satellites. And this would not be done one-by-\\n ‘one but concurrently, in a muif-dimensional fashion. In the\\n development of payloads for the sounding rockets, instead\\n ‘of getting a certain payload and then engineering it to fit\\n info the rocket, we discussed the matter threadbare with\\n the payload scientists working in different organ-izations\\n and at different locations. | may even say that the most\\n significant achievement of the sounding rocket programme\\n was to establish and maintain nation-wide mutual trust.\\n \\n Perhaps realising that | preferred to persuade people to\\n do as they were told rather than use my legitimate authority,\\n Prof. Sarabhai assigned me the task of providing interface\\n support to payload scientists. Almost all physical\\n laboratories in India were involved in the sounding racket\\n programme, each having its own mission, its own objective\\n and its own payload. These payloads were required to he\\n integrated to the rocket structure so as to ensure their\\n proper functioning and endurance under fight conditions.\\n We had X-ray payloads to look at stars; payloads fitted with\\n radio frequency mass spectrometers to analyse the gas,\\n composition of the upper atmosphere; sodium payloads to\\n find out wind conditions, its direction and velocity, We also\\n had ionospheric payloads to explore different layers of the\\n atmosphere. | not only had to interact with scientists from\\n TIFR, National Physical Laboratory (NPL), and Physical\\n Research Laboratory (PRL), but also with payload\\n scientists from USA, USSR, France, Germany and Japan.\\n \\n often read Khail Gibran, and always find his words full\\n of wisdom. “Bread baked without love is a bitter bread that\\n feeds but half a man\\'s hunger,’—those who cannot work\\n vith their hearts achieve but a hollow, half-hearted success\\n that breeds bittemess all around. if you are a writer who\\n would secretly prefer fo be a lawyer ora doctor, your written\\n words will feed but half the hunger of your readers; if you\\n are a teacher who would rather be 2 businessman, your\\n instructions will meet but half the need for knowledge of\\n your students; ifyou are a scientist who hates science, your\\n performance will satisfy but half the needs of your mission,\\n ‘The personal unhappiness and failure to achieve results\\n that comes from being a round peg in a square hole is not,\\n by any means, new, But there are exceptions to this like\\n Prof. Oda and Sudhakar, who bring to their work a personal\\n touch of magic based upon their individual character,\\n personality, inner motives, and perhaps the dreams\\n crystallized within their hearts. They become so emotionally\\n \\x0cinvolved with their work that any dilution of the success of\\n their effort fils them with grief.\\n \\n Prof. Oda was an X-ray payload scientist from the\\n hstitute of Space and Aeronautical Sciences (AS),\\n Japan. Iremember him as a diminutive man with a towering\\n personality and eyes that radiated intelligence. His\\n dedication to his work was exemplary. He would bring X-\\n ray payloads from ISAS, which along with the X-ray\\n payloads made by Prof. UR Rao, would be engineered by\\n my team to fit into the nose cone of the Rohini Rocket. At\\n an altitude of 150 km, the nose cone would be separated\\n by explosion of pyros triggered by an electronic timer. With\\n this, the X-ray sensors would be exposed to space for\\n collecting the required information about the emissions\\n from stars. Together, Prof Oda and Prof. Rao were a\\n unique blend of intellect and dedication, which one rarely\\n sees. One day, when I was working on the integration for\\n Prof. Oda\\'s payload with my timer devices, he insisted on\\n using the timers he had brought from Japan, To me they\\n looked fimsy, but Prof, Oda stuck to his stand that the\\n hidian timers be replaced by the Japanese ones. | yielded\\n to his suggestion and replaced the timers. The racket took\\n off elegantly and attained the intended altitude. But the\\n telemety signal reported mission failure on account of\\n timer malfunction, Prof. Oda was so upset that tears welled\\n up in his eyes. Iwas stunned by the emotional intensity of\\n Prof. Oda\\'s response. He had clearly put his heart and soul\\n into his work.\\n \\n Sudhakar was my colleague in the Payload Preparation\\n Laboratory. As part of the pre-launch schedule, we were\\n filing and remotely pressing the hazardous sodium and\\n themite mix. As usual, it was a hot and humid day at\\n Tumba. After the sixth such operation, Sudhakar and |\\n went into the payload room to confirm the proper filling of\\n the mix. Suddenly, a drop of sweat from his forehead fell\\n ‘onto the sodium, and before we knew what was happening,\\n there was a violent explosion which shook the room. For a\\n few paralysed seconds, | did not know what to do. The fire\\n ‘was spreading, and water would not extinguish the sodium\\n fire. Trapped in this inferno, Sudhakar, however, did not\\n lose his presence of mind. He broke the glass window with\\n his bare hands and literally threw me out to safety before\\n jumping out himself. I touched Sudhakar\\'s bleeding hands\\n in gratitude, he was smiling through his pain. Sudhakar\\n spent many weeks in the hospital recuperating from the\\n sever bums ne had recelved\\n \\n ERLS, | was involved with rocket preparation\\n acthites, payload assembly, testing and evaluation\\n besides building subsystems ike payload housing and\\n jettisonable nose cones. Working with the nose cones led\\n me, a8 a natural consequence, into the field of composite\\n materials.\\n \\n I is interesting to know that the bows found, during\\n archaeological excavations at different sites in the country,\\n reveal that Indians used composite bows made of wood,\\n sinew, and horn as early as the eleventh century, at least\\n 500 years before such bows were made in medieval\\n Europe. The versatility of composites, in the sense that they\\n possess very desirable structural, thermal, electical,\\n chemical and mechanical properties, fascinated me. Iwas\\n so enthused with these man-made materials that Iwas ina\\n hurry to know everyting about them almost ovemight. |\\n used to read up everything available on related topics. |\\n was particulary interested in the glass and carbon Fibre\\n Reinforced Plastic (FRP) composites,\\n \\n ‘An FRP composite is composed of an inorganic fibre\\n \\x0cwoven into a matrix that encloses it and gives the\\n component its bulk form. In February 1969, Prime Minister\\n ndira Gandhi visited Thumba to dedicate TERLS to the\\n Intemational Space Science Community. On this occasion,\\n she commissioned the country\\'s first filament winding\\n machine in our laboratory. This event brought my team,\\n which included CR Satya, PN Subramanian and MN\\n Satyanara-yana, great satisfaction, We made highstength\\n glass cloth laminates to build non-magnetic payload\\n housings and flew them in two-stage sounding rockets. We\\n also wound and test flew rocket motor casings of up to 360\\n mm diameter.\\n \\n Slowly, but surely, two Indian rockets were born at\\n ‘Thumba. They were christened Rohini and Menaka, after\\n the two mythological dancers in the court of Indra, the king\\n of the sky. The Indian payloads no longer needed to be\\n launched by French rockets. Could this have been done but\\n for the atmosphere of trust and commitment which Prof.\\n Sarabhai had created at INCOSPAR? He brought into use\\n each person\\'s knowedge and skills. He made every man\\n feel directly involved in problem solving. By the very fact of\\n the team members! participation, the solutions became:\\n genuine and earned the trust of the entire team resulting in\\n total commitment towards implementation.\\n \\n Prof. Sarabhai was matter-offact and never tied to\\n tide his disappointment. He used to talk with us in an\\n honest and objective manner. Sometimes | found him\\n making things look more positive than they actually were,\\n and then chamning us by his almost magical powers of\\n persuasion. When we were at the drawing board, he would\\n bring someone from the developed world for a technical\\n collaboration. That was his subtle way of challenging each\\n ‘one of us to stretch our capabilities.\\n \\n ie same time, even if we failed to meet certain\\n objectives, he woud praise whatever we had\\n aceomplished. Whenever he found any one of us going\\n cover his head and attempting a task for which he did not\\n have the capability or skill, Prof. Sarabhai would reassign\\n activity in such a way so as to lower pressure and permit\\n better quality work to be performed. By the time the first\\n Rohini-75 rocket was launched from TERLS on 20\\n November 1967, almost each one of us was in his own\\n groove.\\n \\n Early next year, Prof, Sarabhai wanted to see_me\\n urgently in Deli. By now I was accustomed to Prof.\\n Sarabhai\\'s working methods. He was always full of\\n enthusiasm and optimism. hr such a state of mind, sudden\\n flashes of inspiration were almost natural. On reaching\\n Delhi, | contacted Prof. Sarabhai\\'s secretary for an\\n appointment and was asked to meet him at 3.30 am. at\\n Hotel Ashoka. Delhi being a slightly unfamiliar place, with\\n an unfriendly climate for someone like me, conditioned to\\n the warm and humid climate of South India, I decided to\\n wait in the hotel lounge afer finishing my dinner.\\n \\n Ihave always been a religious person in the sense that |\\n maintain a working partnership with God. I was aware that\\n the best work required more ability than I possessed and\\n therefore Ineeded help that only God could give me. Imade\\n a true estimate of my own ability, then raised it by 50 per\\n cent and put myself in God\\'s hands. In this partnership, |\\n have always received all the power I needed, and in fact\\n have actually felt it flowing through me. Today, | can affirm\\n that the kingdom of God is within you in the form of this\\n power, to help achieve your goals and realise your dreams.\\n \\n ‘There are mary different types and levels of experience\\n \\x0cthat turn this intemal power reaction critical. Sometimes,\\n when we are ready, the gentlest of contacts with Him fils us\\n with insight and wisdom. This could come from an\\n encounter with another person, from a word, a question, a\\n gesture or even a look. Many a time, it could come even\\n through a book, a conversation, some phrase, even a ine\\n from a poem or the mere sight of a picture. Without the\\n slightest waming, something new breaks into your life and a\\n secret decision is taken, a decision that you may be\\n completely unconscious of, to start with.\\n \\n Hooked around the elegant lounge. Somebody had left\\n a book on a nearby sofa. As if to fill the small hours of that\\n cold night with some warm thoughts, | picked up the book\\n and started browsing. I must have turned only a few pages\\n ofthe book, aboutwhich | do notremember a thing today.\\n \\n was some popular book related to business\\n management. Iwas not really reading it, only skimming over\\n paragraphs and turning pages. Suddenly, my eyes fell on a\\n passage in the book, it was a quotation from George\\n Bemard Shaw. The gist of the quote was that all\\n reasonable men adapt themselves to the world. Only a few\\n unreasonable ones persist in trying to adapt the world to\\n themselves. All progress in the world depends on these\\n unreasonable men and their innovative and often\\n nonconformist actions.\\n \\n I started reading the book from the Bernard Shaw\\n passage onwards. The author was describing certain\\n myths woven around the concept and the process of\\n innovation in industry and business. lead about the myth of\\n strategic planing. I is generally believed that substantial\\n strategic and technological planning greatly increases the\\n ‘odds of a ‘no surprises’ outcome. The author was of the\\n ‘opinion that itis essential for a project manager to learn to.\\n live with uncertainty and ambiguity. He felt that itwas a myth\\n to hold thatthe key fo economic success is computability. A\\n quotation from General George Patton was given as a\\n counterpoint to this myth—that a good plan violently\\n executed right now is far better than a perfect plan\\n executed next week. Itis a myth that to win big one must\\n strive to optimize, the author felt. Optimization wins only on\\n paper, but would invariably lose later in the real world, the\\n \\n said\\n \\n Waiting in the hotel lobby at 1 a.m. for an appointment\\n ‘two hours later was certainly not a reasonable proposition,\\n neither for me nor for Prof. Sarabhai. But then, Prof.\\n Sarabhai had always exhibited a sttong component of\\n unorthodoxy in his character. He was running the show of\\n space research in the country—under-staffed, overworked\\n — nevertheless in a successful manner.\\n \\n Suddenly, became aware of another man who came\\n and sat down on the sofa opposite mine. He was a wel-\\n built person with an intelligent look and refined posture.\\n Unlike me—always disorderly in my dress— this man was\\n wearing elegant clothes. Notwithstanding the odd hours, he\\n was alert and vivacious.\\n \\n ere was a strange magnetism about him which\\n derailed the train of my thoughts on innovation. And before |\\n could get back to the book, | was informed that Prof.\\n Sarabhai was ready to receive me. | left the book on the\\n nearby sofa from where | had picked it up. | was surprised\\n when the man sitting on the opposite sofa was also asked\\n fo come inside. Who was he? It was not long before my\\n question was answered. Even before we sat down, Prof.\\n Sarabhai intoduced us to each other. He was Group\\n Captain VS Narayanan from Air Headquarters.\\n Prof. Sarabhai ordered coffee for both of us and\\n \\x0cunfolded his plan of developing a rocket-assisted take-off\\n system (RATO) for military aircraft. This would help our\\n ‘warplanes to take off from short runways in the Himalayas.\\n Hot coffee was served over small talk. it was totally\\n uncharacteristic of Prof. Sarabhai. But as soon as we\\n finished the coffee, Prof, Saraishai rose and asked us to\\n accompany him to Tlpat Range on the outskirts of Delhi\\n As we were passing through the lobby, I threw a cursory\\n glance at the sofa where I had left the book. Itwas not there.\\n \\n Iwas about an hour\\'s drive to the Range. Prof.\\n Sarabhai showed us a Russian RATO. “if I get you the\\n motors of this system from Russia, coud you do it in\\n eighteen months time?\" Prof. Sarabhai asked us. “Yes, we\\n can!\" Both Gp Capt VS Narayanan and | spoke almost\\n simultaneously. Prof. Sarabhai\\'s face beamed, reflecting\\n ‘our fascination. | recalled what | had read, ‘He will bestow\\n ‘on you a light to walkin.”\\n \\n ‘After dropping us back at the Hotel Ashoka, Prof.\\n Sarabhai went to the Prime Minister\\'s house for a\\n breakfast meeting. By that evening, the news of India taking\\n up the indigenous development of a device to help short run\\n take-offs by high performance military aircraft, with myself\\n heading the project, was made public. Iwas filled with many\\n emotions— happiness, gratitude, a sense of fulfiment and\\n these ines from a littleknown poet of the nineteenth-century\\n crossed my mind:\\n \\n For all your days prepare\\n And meet them ever alike\\n When you are the anvil, bear—\\n \\n When you are the hammer, strike.\\n \\n \"S were mounted on aircraft to provide the\\n additional thrust required during the take-off run under\\n certain adverse operating conditions like partially bombed-\\n ‘out runways, high altitude airfields, more than the\\n prescribed load, or very high ambient temperatures. The\\n Air Force was in dire need of a large number of RATO\\n motors for their $22 and HF-24 aircraft.\\n \\n The Russian RATO motor shown to us at the Tilpat\\n Range was capable of generating 3000 kg thrust with a\\n total impulse of 24500 kgseconds. it weighed 220 kg and\\n had a double base propellant encased in steel. The\\n development work was fo be carried out at the Space\\n Science and Technology Centre with the assistance of the\\n Defence Research and Development Organization\\n (DRDO)}, HAL, DTD&P (Ain) and Air Headquarters.\\n \\n After a detailed analysis of the available options, |\\n chose a fibreglass motor casing. We decided in favour of a\\n composite propellant which gives a higher specific impulse\\n and aimed ata longer burning time to utilize it completely. |\\n also decided t take addifonal safety measures by\\n incorporating a diaphragm which would rupture if the\\n chamber pressure for some reason exceeded twice the\\n operating pressure. Two significant developments occurred\\n during the work on RATO. The first was the release of a\\n ten-year profile for space research in the country, prepared\\n by Prof. Sarabhai. This profile was not merely an activity\\n plan laid down by the top ran for his team to comply with, it\\n was a theme paper meant for open discussions, to be later\\n transformed into a programme. h fact, | found it was the\\n romantic manifesto of a person deeply in love with the\\n space research programme in his count\\n \\n The plan mainly centred around the early ideas which\\n had been born at NCOSPAR; it included utilization of\\n satellites for television and developmental education,\\n meteorological observations and remote sensing. for\\n \\x0cmanagement of natural resources. To this had been added\\n the development and launch of satellite launch vehicles.\\n \\n The active international cooperation dominant in the\\n early years was virtually eased out in this plan and the\\n emphasis. was on selfreiance and indigenous,\\n technologies. The plan taked about the realisation of a\\n SLV for injecting lightweight satelites into a low earth orbit,\\n upgrading of Indian satelites from laboratory models to\\n space entities and development of a wide range of\\n spacecraft subsystems like the apogee and booster\\n motors, momentum wheel, and solar panel deployment\\n mechanism. also promised a wide range of technological\\n spin-offs like the gyros, various types of transducers,\\n telemety, adhesives, and polymers for non-space\\n applications. Over and above, there was the dream of an\\n adequate infrastructure that would be capable of supporting\\n R&D ina variety of engineering and scientific disciplines.\\n \\n ‘The second developmentwas the formation of a Missile\\n Panel in the Ministry of Defence. Both Narayanan and |\\n were inducted as members. The idea of making missiles in\\n ‘our own country was exciting, and we spent hours on end\\n studying the missiles of various advanced counties.\\n \\n The distinction between a tactical missile and a\\n strategic missile is often a fine one. Generaly, by\\n ‘strategic’, itis understood that the missile will fy thousands,\\n of kilometres. However, in warfare, this term is used to\\n denote the kind of target rather than its distance from\\n mmissile launch. Strategic missiles are those that stike at\\n the enemy\\'s heartland, either in counter-force attacks on\\n their strategic forces or in counter-value attacks on the\\n society, which in essence means his cies. Tactical\\n weapons are those that influence a baitle, and the battle\\n may be by land, sea or air, or on all three together. This\\n categorization now appears nonsensical, as the US Air\\n Force\\'s ground-launched Tomahawk is used in a tactical\\n role, notwithstanding its range of some 3000 km. In those\\n days, however, strategic missiles were synonymous with\\n intermediate range ballistic missiles (RBMs) with ranges in\\n the order of 1500 nautical miles or 2780 km and inter:\\n continental balistic missiles (CBMs) with a capability of\\n going even further.\\n \\n Gp Capt Narayanan had an ineffable enthusiasm for\\n indigenous guided missiles. He was a great admirer of the\\n strong am approach of the Russian Missile Development\\n Programme. “When it could be done there, why not here,\\n where space research has already prepared the soil for a\\n bonanza of missile technology?\" Narayanan used to needle\\n \\n me.\\n \\n The bitter lessons of the two wars in 1962 and 1965\\n had left the dian leadership with litle choice in the matter\\n of achieving self-reliance in military hardware and wea}\\n systems. A large number of Surfaceto-Air Missiles (SAMs)\\n were obtained from the USSR to guard strategic locations.\\n Gp Capt Narayanan passionately advocated the\\n development of these missiles in the county.\\n \\n While working together on RATO motors and on the\\n Missile Panel, Narayanan and I played the roles of student\\n and teacher interchangeably wherever required. He was\\n very eager to learn about rocketry and Iwas very curious to\\n know about airbome weapon systems. The depth of\\n Narayanan’s conviction and his force of application were\\n inspiring. Right from the day of our pre-dawn visit to the\\n Tipat Range with Prof. Sarabhai, Narayanan was always\\n busy with his RATO motor. He had arranged everything that\\n was required before being asked. He obtained funding of\\n Rs 75 lakhs with a further commitment towards any\\n \\x0cunforeseen costs. “You name the thing and | will get it for\\n you, but do not ask for time,” he said. At times, | offen\\n laughed at his impatience, and read for him these lines,\\n from T.S. Eliot\\'s Hollow Men:\\n \\n Between the conception\\n And the creation\\n Between the emotion\\n And the response\\n Falls the Shadow\\n \\n Defence R&D at that time was heavily dependent on\\n imported equipment. Virtually nothing indigenous was\\n available. Together, we made a long shopping list and\\n drew up an import plan. But this made me unhappy—was\\n there no remedy or alternative? Was this nation doomed to\\n live with screwdriver technology? Could a poor country ike\\n hia afford this kind of development?\\n \\n One day, while working late in the office, which was\\n quite routine after I took up the RATO projects, | saw a\\n young colleague, Jaya Chandra Babu going home. Babu\\n had joined us a few months ago and the only thing I knew\\n about him was that he had a very positive attitude and was\\n articulate. I called him into my office and did a bit of loud\\n thinking. “Do you have any suggestions? \"I then asked him,\\n Babu remained silent for a while, and then asked for time\\n until the next evening to do some homework before\\n answering my question.\\n \\n The next evening, Babu came to me before the\\n appointed time. His face was beaming with promise. “We\\n can do it, sir! The RATO system can be made without\\n imports. The only hurdle is the inherent inelasticity in the\\n approach of the organization towards procurement and\\n subcontracting, which would be the two major thrust areas\\n to avoid imports.\" He gave me seven points, or, rather,\\n asked for seven liberties—financial approval by a single\\n person instead of an entire hierarchy, air travel for all\\n \\n eople on work irrespective of their entitlement,\\n accountability to only one person, lifting of goods by air-\\n cargo, sub-contracting to the private sector, placement of\\n orders on the basis of technical competence, and\\n expeditious accounting procedures.\\n \\n These demands were unheard of in govemment\\n establishments, which tend to be conservative, yet | could\\n see the soundness of his proposition. The RATO project\\n was a new game and there was nothing wrong if it was to\\n be played with a new set of rules. Iweighed all the pros and\\n cons of Babu\\'s suggestions for a whole night and finally\\n decided to present them to Prof, Sarabhai. Hearing my\\n plea for administrative liberalization and seeing the merits,\\n behind it, Prof. Sarabhai approved the proposals without a\\n second thought\\n \\n Through his suggestions, Babu had highlighted the\\n importance of business acumen in developmental work\\n with high stakes. To make things move faster within\\n existing work parameters, you have to pump in more\\n people, more material and more money. Ifyou can\\'t do that,\\n change your parameters! Instinctive businessman that he\\n was, Babu did not remain long with us and left ISRO for\\n greener pastures in Nigeria. I could never forget Babu\\'s\\n common sense in financial matters,\\n \\n We had opted for a composite structure for the RATO\\n motor casing using filament fibre glass/epowy. We had also\\n gone in for a high energy composite propellant and an\\n event-based ignition and jettisoning system in real-time. A\\n canted nozzle was designed to deflect the jet away from the\\n aircraft. We conducted the first static test of RATO in the\\n \\x0c‘twelfth month of the project initiation. Within the next four\\n months, we conducted 64 static tests. And we were just\\n about 20 engineers working on the project!\\n \\x0c\\x0cMovers\\n \\n ‘The future satelite launch vehicle (SLV) had also been\\n conceived by this time. Recognising the immense socio-\\n economic benefits of space technology, Prof. Sarabhai\\n decided in 1969, to go full-steam ahead with the task of\\n establishing indigenous capability in building and launching\\n ‘our own satelites. He personally participated in an aerial\\n survey of the east coast for a possible site for launching\\n satellite launch vehicles and large rockets.\\n \\n bhai was concentrating on the east coast in\\n order to let the launch vehicle take full advantage of the\\n earth\\'s west to east rotation. He finally selected the\\n Sriharikota island, 100 km north of Madras (now Chennai),\\n and thus the SHAR Rocket Launch Station was born. The\\n crescent-shaped island has a maximum width of & km and\\n lies alongside the coastine. The island is as big as Madras,\\n city. The Buckingham Canal and the Puiicat lake form its\\n western boundary.\\n \\n hh 1968, we had formed the Indian Rocket Society\\n Soon after, the INCOSPAR was reconstituted as an\\n advisory body under the Indian National Science Academy\\n (INSA) and the Indian Space Research Organization\\n (ISRO) was created under the Department of Atomic\\n Energy (DAE) to conduct space research in the county,\\n \\n By this time, Prof. Sarabhai had already hand-picked a\\n team to give form to his dream ofan Indian SLV. I consider\\n myself fortunate to have been chosen to be a project\\n leader. Prof, Sarabhai gave me the additional\\n responsibilty of designing the fourth stage of the SLY. Dr\\n VR Gowarikar, MR Kurup and AE Muthunayagam were\\n given the tasks of designing the other three stages.\\n \\n What made Prof. Sarabhai pick a few of us for this\\n great mission? One reason seemed to be our professional\\n background. Dr Gowarikar was doing outstanding work in\\n the field of composite propellants. MR Kurup had\\n established an excellent laboratory for propellants,\\n propulsion and pyrotechnics. Muthunayagam had proved\\n himself in the field of high energy propellants. The fourth\\n stage was to be a composite structure and called for a\\n large number of innovations in fabrication technology,\\n perhaps thatwas why Iwas brought in.\\n \\n Hlaid the foundation for Stage IV on two rocks—sensible\\n approximation and unawed support. | have always\\n considered the price of perfection prohibitive and allowed\\n mistakes as a part of the learning process. Iprefer a dash\\n of daring and persistence to perfection. | have always\\n supported leaming on the part of my team members by\\n paying vigilant attention to each of their attempts, be they\\n Successful or unsuccessful\\n \\n hr my group, progress was recognized and reinforced at\\n every tiny step. Although | provided access to all the\\n information that my co-workers in Stage IV needed, Ifound |\\n could not spend enough time to be a useful facilitator and a\\n source of support. | wondered if there was something\\n wrong with the way in which I managed my tme. At this,\\n stage, Prof. Sarabhai brought a French visitor to our work\\n centre to point out the problem to me. This gentleman was\\n Prof. Curien, President of CNES (Centre Nationale de\\n Etudes Spatiales), our counterpart in France. They were\\n then developing the Diamont launch vehicles. Prof. Curien\\n ‘was a thorough professional, Together, Prof. Sarabhai and\\n Prof. Curien helped me set a target. While they discussed\\n the means by which I could reach it, they also cautioned me\\n about the possibilities of failure. While | arrived at a better\\n \\x0cawareness of Stage IV problems through the supportive\\n counselling of Prof. Curien, Prof. Sarabhai\\'s catalytic\\n intervention led Prof. Curien to reinterpret his own progress,\\n in the Diamont programme.\\n \\n Prof. Curien advised Prof. Sarabhai to relieve me of all\\n the minor jobs which posed litte challenge and to give me\\n more opportunities for achievement He was so impressed\\n by our well-planned efforts that he inquired if we could\\n make the Diamont\\'s fourth stage. Irecall how this broughta\\n subtle smile to Prof. Sarabhai\\'s face.\\n \\n $ @ matter of fact, the Diamont and SLY airframes\\n were incompatible. The diameters were quite different and\\n to attain interchangeability, some radical innovations were.\\n required. Iwondered where I should start. I decided to look\\n around for solutions among my own colleagues. | used to\\n carefully observe my colleagues to see if their daily routine\\n reflected their desire to constanty experiment. lalso started\\n asking and listening to anyone who showed the slightest\\n promise. Some of my friends cautioned me about what they\\n termed as my naivete. Imade itan unfailing routine to make\\n notes on individual suggestions and gave handwritten\\n notes to colleagues in engineering and design, requesting\\n concrete follow-up action within five or ten days.\\n \\n This method worked wonderfully well. Prof. Curien\\n testified, while reviewing our progress, that we had\\n achieved in a year\\'s time what our counterparts in Europe.\\n could barely manage in three years. Our plus point, he\\n noted, was that each of us worked with those below and\\n above in the hierarchy. | made ita point to have the team\\n meet at least once every week. Though it took up time and\\n energy, Iconsidered it essential\\n \\n How good is a leader? No better than his people and\\n their commitment and participation in the project as full\\n partners! The fact that I got them all together to share\\n whatever litle development had been achieved— results,\\n experiences, small successes, and the like—seemed to\\n me worth putting all my energy and time into. twas a vei\\n small price to pay for that commitment and sense of\\n teamwork, which could in fact he called trust. Within my own\\n small group of people | found leaders, and learned that\\n leaders exist at every level. This was another important\\n aspect of management that Ilearned\\n \\n We had modified the existing SLVV Stage design to\\n suit the Diamont airframe. ft was reconfigured and\\n upgraded from a 250 kg, 400 mm diameter stage to a 600\\n kg, 650 mm diameter stage. After two years’ effort, when\\n we were about to deliver it to CNES, the French suddenly\\n cancelled their Diamont BC programme. They told us that\\n they did not need our Stage IV anymore. It was a great\\n shock, making me re-live the earlier disappointments at\\n Dehra Dun, when [filed to get into the Air Force, and at\\n Bangalore, when the Nandi project was aborted at ADE\\n \\n Thad invested great hope and effort in the fourth stage,\\n so that it could be flown with a Diamont rocket The other\\n three stages of SLY, involving enormous work in the area\\n of rocket propulsion were at least five years away.\\n However, it did not take me long to shee the\\n disappointment of Diamont BC Stage IV. After all, I had\\n thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. h time, RATO\\n filled the vacuum created in me by the Diamont BC Stage.\\n \\n When the RATO project was underway, the SLV project\\n slowly started taking shape. Competence for all major\\n systems of a launch vehicle had been established in\\n Thumba by now. Through their outstanding efforts, Vasant\\n Gowarikar, MR Kurup and Muthunayagam prepared\\n TERLS fora big leap in rockety.\\n \\x0cProf. Sarabhai was an exemplar in the art of team-\\n building. On one occasion, he had to identify a person who\\n could be given the responsibility for developing a\\n telecommand system for the SLV. Two men were\\n competent to carry out this task—one was the seasoned\\n and sophisticated UR Rao and the other was a relatively\\n unknown experimenter, G Madhavan Nair. Although Iwas\\n deeply impressed by Madhavan Nair\\'s dedication and\\n abilities, | did not rate his chances as very good. During\\n one of Prof. Sarabhai\\'s routine visits, Madhavan Nair boldly\\n demonstrated fis improvised but high reliable\\n telecommand system. Prof. Sarabhai did not take much\\n time to back the young experimenter in preference to an\\n established expert. Madhavan Nair not only iived up to the\\n expectations of his leader but even went beyond them. He\\n was to later become the project director of the Polar\\n Satelite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).\\n \\n SLVs and missiles can be called first cousins: they are\\n different in concept and purpose, but come from the same\\n bloodiine of rocketry. A massive missile development\\n project had been taken up by DRDO at the Defence\\n Research & Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad\\n As the pace of this surface-to-air missile development\\n project increased, the frequency of the Missile Panel\\n meetings and my interaction with Gp Capt Narayanan also\\n increase\\n \\n h 1968, Prof, Sarabhai came to Thumba on one of his\\n routine visits. He was shown the operation of the nose-cone\\n jettisoning mechanism. As always, we were all anxious to\\n share the resuits of our work with Prof. Sarabhai. We\\n requested Prof. Sarabhai to formally activate the pyro\\n system through a timer circuit Prof. Sarabhai smiled, and\\n pressed the button, To our horror, nothing happened. We\\n were dumbstruck. | looked at Pramod Kale, who had\\n designed and integrated the timer circuit. ha flash each of\\n us mentally went through an aniysis of the failure. We\\n requested Prof, Sarabhai to wait for a few minutes, then we\\n detached the timer device, giving direct connection to the\\n pyros. Prof, Sarabhai pressed the button again. The pyros,\\n were fired and the nose cone was jettisoned. Prof.\\n Sarabhai congratulated Kale and me; but his expression\\n suggested that his thoughts were elsewhere. We could not\\n ‘guess what was on his mind. The suspense did not last for\\n long and I got a call from Prof. Sarabhai\\'s secretary to meet\\n tim after dinner for an important discussion,\\n \\n Prof. Sarabhai was staying at the Kovalam Palace\\n Hotel, his usual home whenever he was in Trivandrum. |\\n was slightly perplexed by the summons. Prof. Sarabhai\\n greeted me with his customary warmth. He talked of the\\n rocket launching station, envisaging facilities ike launch\\n pads, block houses, radar, telemetry and so on—things\\n which are taken for granted in Indian space research today.\\n Then he brought up the incident that had occurred that\\n moming. This was exactly what | had feared. My\\n apprehension of a reproach from my leader, however, was\\n unfounded. Prof. Sarabhai did not conclude that the failure\\n ‘of the pyro timer circuit was the outcome of insufficient\\n knowledge and lack of skill on the part of his people or of\\n faully understanding at the direction stage. He asked me\\n instead, if we were unenthused by a job that did not pose\\n sufficient challenge. He also asked me to consider if my\\n ‘work was possibly being affected by any problem of which |\\n was hitherto unaware. He finally put his finger on the key\\n issue. We lacked a single roof to camy out system\\n integration of all our rocket stages and rocket systems.\\n \\x0cElectrical and mechanical integration work was going on\\n vith @ significant phase difference—both in time and in\\n space. There was little effort to bring together the disparate\\n work on electical and mechanical integration. Prof.\\n Sarabhai spent the next hour in re-defiring our tasks, and,\\n in the small hours of the moming, the decision to set up a\\n Rocket Engineering Section was taken\\n \\n Mistakes can delay or prevent the proper achievement\\n of the objectives of individuals and organizations, but a\\n visionary like Prof. Sarabhai can use errors as\\n ‘opportunities to promote innovation and the development of\\n new ideas. He was not especially concerned with the\\n mmistake in the timer circuit, least of all with pinning the\\n blame for it. Prof. Sarabhai\\'s approach to mistakes rested\\n ‘on the assumption that they were inevitable but generally\\n manageable. Iwas in the handling of the crises that arose\\n as a consequence that talent could often be revealed. Ilater\\n realised by experience, that the best way to prevent errors\\n was to anticipate them. But this time, by a strange twist of\\n fate, the failure of the timer circuit led to the birth ofa rocket\\n engineering laboratory.\\n \\n Twas my usual practice to brief Prof. Sarabhai after\\n every Missile Panel Meeting. After attending one such\\n meeting in Delhi on 30 December 1971, | was returning to\\n Tivandrum. Prof, Sarabhai was visiting Thumba that very\\n day to review the SLV design. | spoke to him on the\\n telephone from the airport lounge about the salient points\\n that had emerged at the panel meeting. He instructed me to\\n wait at Trivandrum Airport after disembarking from the\\n Delhi fight, and to meet him there before his departure for\\n Bombay the same night.\\n \\n When Ireached Tiivandrum, a pall of gloom hung in the\\n air. The aircraft ladder operator Kutty told me in a choked\\n woice that Prof. Sarabhai was no more. He had passed\\n away a few hours ago, following a cardiac arrest. | was,\\n shocked to the core; it had happened within an hour of our\\n conversation. Itwas a great blow to me and a huge loss to\\n Indian science. That night passed in preparations for\\n airlifting Prof. Sarabhai\\'s body for the cremation in\\n Ahmedabad\\n \\n For five years, between 1966 to 1971, about 22\\n scientists and engineers had worked closely with Prof.\\n Sarabhai. All of them were later to take charge of important\\n scientific projects. Not only was Prof. Sarabhai a great\\n scientist, but also a great leader. | stil remember him\\n reviewing the bi-monthly progress of the design projects of\\n SLV-3 in June 1970. Presentations on Stages Ito IV were\\n arranged. The first three presentations went through\\n smoothly. Mine was the last presentation. | introduced five\\n ‘of my team members who had contributed in various ways\\n fo the design. To everybodys surprise, each of them\\n presented his portion of the work with authority and\\n confidence. The presentations were discussed at length\\n and the conclusion was that satisfactory progress had been\\n made.\\n Suddenly, a senior scientist who worked closely with\\n Prof. Sarabhai turned to me and enquired, “Well, the\\n presentations for your project were made by your team\\n members based on their work. But what did you do for the\\n project?\" That was the first time I saw Prof, Sarabhai really\\n annoyed. He told his colleague, “You ought to know what\\n project management is all about. We just witnessed an\\n excellent example. It was an outstanding demonstration of\\n team work. | have always seen a project leader as an\\n integrator of people and that is precisely what Kalam is.\" |\\n consider Prof Sarabhai as the Mahatma Gandhi of Indian\\n \\x0cscience —generating leadership qualities in his team and\\n inspiring them through both ideas and example.\\n an interim amangement with Prof. MGK Menon at\\n the helm, Prof. Satish Dhawan was given the responsibilty\\n of heading ISRO. The whole complex at Thumba, which\\n included TERLS, the Space Science and Technology\\n Centre (SSTC), the RPP, the Rocket Fabrication Facility\\n (RFF), and the Propellant Fuel Complex (PFC) were\\n merged together to form an integrated space centre and\\n christened the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) as,\\n a tribute to the man to whom it owed its existence. The\\n renowned metallurgist, Dr Brahm Prakash, took over as the\\n first Director of VSSC.\\n  RATO system was successfully tested on 8\\n October 1972 at Bareilly Air Force station in Uttar Pradesh,\\n when a high perfomance Sukhoi-16 jet aircraft became\\n airbome after a shortrun of 1200 m, as against its usual run\\n of 2 km. We used the 66th RATO motor in the test. The\\n demonstration was watched by Air Marshal Shivdev Singh\\n and Dr BD Nag Chaudhury, then the Scientific Adviser to\\n the Defence Minister. This effort was said to have saved\\n approximately Rs 4 crores in foreign exchange. The vision\\n of the industrialist scientist had finally bome fit\\n \\n Before taking up the responsibility of organizing space\\n research in India and becoming the chairman of\\n NCOSPAR, Prof. Sarabhai had established a number of\\n successful industial enterprises. He was aware that\\n scientific research could not survive in isolation, away from\\n industry. Prof. Sarabhai founded Sarabhai Chemicals,\\n Sarabhai Glass, Sarabhai Geigy Limited, Sarabhai Merck\\n Limited, and the Sarabhai Engineering Group. His Swastik\\n Oil Mills did pioneering work in the extraction of oil from\\n oilseeds, manufacture of synthetic deteryents and of\\n cosmetics. He geared Standard Pharmaceuticals Limited\\n to enable large-scale manufacture of pericillin, which was\\n imported from abroad at astronomical costs at that time.\\n Now with the indigenization of RATO, his mission had\\n acquired a new dimension—independence in the\\n manufacture of military hardware and the potential saving of\\n crores of rupees in foreign exchange. | recalled this on the\\n day of the successful tial of the RATO system. Including\\n trial expenses, we spent less than Rs. 25 lakhs on the\\n entire project. The Indian RATO could be produced at\\n Rs.17,000 apiece, and it replaced the imported RATO,\\n which cost Rs. 33,000\\n \\n At the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, work on the\\n SLV went on at full swing. All the subsystems had been\\n designed, technologies identified, processes established,\\n work centres. selected, manpower earmarked and\\n schedules drawn. The only hitch was the lack of a\\n management stucture to effectively handle this mega-\\n project and coordinate activities which were spread over a\\n large number of work centres with their own ways of\\n ‘working and management.\\n \\n Prof. Dhawan, in consutation with Dr Brahm Prakash,\\n picked me for this job. | was appointed the Project\\n Manager—SLV, and reported directly to the Director,\\n VSSC. My first task was to work out a project management\\n plan. Iwondered why Iwas selected for this task when there\\n were stalwarts like Gowarikar, Muthunayagam, and Kurup\\n around. With organizers like Easwardas, Aravamudan, and\\n SC Gupta available, how would I do better? larticulated my\\n doubts to Dr Brahm Prakash, He told me not to focus on\\n what I saw as other people\\'s strengths compared to my\\n ‘own, butinstead, to attempt to expand their abilities.\\n \\x0crahm Prakash advised me to take care of the\\n performance degraders and cautoned me against\\n outighty seeking optimal performance from the\\n participating work centres. ‘Everyone will work to create\\n their bit of SLV; your problem is going to be your\\n dependency on others in accomplishing the total SLV. The\\n SLV mission wil be accomplished with, and through, a\\n large number of people. You will require a tremendous\\n amount of tolerance and patience,” he said. I reminded me\\n of what my father used fo read to me from the Holy Qur\\'an\\n on the distinction between right and wrong: “We have sent\\n no apostle before you who did not eat or walk about the\\n market squares. We test you by means of one another. Will\\n you not have patience?\"\\n \\n Iwas aware of the contradiction that often occurred in\\n such situations. People heading teams often have one of\\n the following two orientations: for some, work is the most\\n important motivation; for others, their workers are the al-\\n consuming interest. There are many others who fall either\\n between these two positions or outside them. My job was\\n going to be to avoid those who were interested neither in\\n the work nor in the workers. I was determined to prevent\\n people from taking either exteme, and to promote\\n conditions where work and workers went together. |\\n visualized my team as a group in which each member\\n ‘worked to enrich the others in the team and experience the\\n enjoyment of working together.\\n \\n ‘The primary objectives of the SLV Project were design,\\n development and operation of a standard SLV system,\\n SLV-3, capable of reliably and expeditiously fulfiling the\\n specified mission of launching a 40 kg satelite into 2 400\\n km circular orbit around the earth\\n \\n As a firststep, Itranslated the primary project objectives\\n info some major tasks. One such task was the development\\n of a rocket motor system for the four stages of the vehicle.\\n ‘The critical problems in the completion of this task were:\\n making an 8.6 tonne propellant grain and a high mass ratio\\n apogee rocket motor system which would use highenergy\\n propellants. Another task was vehicle control and guidance.\\n Three types of control systems were involved in this task—\\n aerodynamic surface control, thrust vector control and\\n reaction control for the first, second and third stages and\\n the spin-up mechanism for the fourth stage. Inertial\\n reference for control systems and guidance through inertial\\n measurement was also imperative. Yet another major task\\n was the augmentation of launch facilites at SHAR with\\n systems integration and checkout facilities and\\n development of launch support systems such as launchers\\n and vehicle assembly fixtures. A target of ‘all line’ fight test\\n vwithin 64 months was set in March 1973.\\n \\n took up the executive responsibility of implementing\\n the project within the framework of policy decisions taken,\\n the approved management plan, and the project report; and\\n also within the budget and through the powers delegated to\\n me by the Director, VSSC. Dr Brahm Prakash formed four\\n Project Advisory Committees to advise me on specialized\\n areas like rocket motors, materials and fabrication, control\\n and guidance, electronics, and mission and launching. |\\n was assured of the guidance of outstanding scientists ike\\n DS Rane, Muthunayagam, TS Prahiad, AR Acharya, SC\\n Gupta, and CL Amba Rao, to name a few.\\n \\n The Holy Qur\\'an says: “We have sent down to you\\n revelations showing you an account of those who have\\n gone before you and an admonition to righteous men.\" |\\n sought to share the wisdom of these extremely brilliant\\n people. \"Light upon light Allah guides to His light whom He\\n \\x0cwill. He has knowledge of all things.”\\n \\n We made three groups to carry out the project activities\\n —a Programme Management Group, an htegration and\\n Fight Testing Group and a Subsystems Development\\n Group. The first Group was made responsible for looking\\n after the overall executive aspects of SLV-3: project\\n management, including administration, planning and\\n evaluation, subsystems specifications, _ materials,\\n fabrication, quality assurance and control. The Integration\\n and Flight Testing Group was assigned the tasks of\\n generation of facilites required for integration and fight\\n testing of SLV-3. They were also asked to camy out the\\n analysis of the vehicle, including mechanical and\\n aerodynamic inteface problems. The Subsystems\\n Development Group was given the job of interacting with\\n various divisions of VSSC and was made responsible for\\n ensuring that all technological problems in the development\\n of various subsystems were overcome by creating a\\n synergy amongst the available talent in these divisions.\\n \\n I projected a requirement of 275 engineers and\\n scientists for SLV-3 but could get only about 90. Fit had not\\n been for synergistic efforts, the whole project would have\\n remained a non-starter. Some young engineers like MSR,\\n Dey, G Madhavan Nair, S Srinivasan, US Singh,\\n Sunderajan, Abdul Majeed, Ved Prakash Sandlas,\\n Nambooditi, Sasi Kumar, and Sivathanu Pillai developed\\n their own ground rules designed to help them work\\n efficiently as a project team, and produced outstanding\\n individual and team results. These men were in the habit of\\n celebrating their successes together—in a sort of mutual\\n appreciation club. This boosted morale, and helped them a\\n great deal to accept setbacks and to revitalize themselves\\n after periods of intense work.\\n \\n member of the SLV-3 project team was a\\n specialist in his own field. tt was natural therefore that each\\n ‘one of them valued his independence. To manage the\\n performance of such specialists the team leader has to\\n adopt a delicate balance between the hands-on and the\\n hands-off approach. The hands-on approach takes an\\n active interest on a very regular basis in the members!\\n work. The hands-off approach trusts team members and\\n recognizes their need for autonomy to carry out their roles,\\n as they see fit. Ithinges on their self-motivation. When the\\n leader goes too far with the hands-on approach, he is seen\\n as an anxious and interfering type. If he goes too far hands-\\n off, he is seen as abdicating his responsibility or not being\\n interested. Today, the members of the SLV-3 team have\\n grown to lead some of the countrys most prestigious\\n programmes. MSR Dev heads the Augmented Satelite\\n Launch Vehicle (ASLV) project, Madhavan Nair is the chief\\n of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) project and\\n Sandlas and Sivathanu Pilai are Chief Controllers. in\\n DRDO Headquarters. Each one of these men rose to his,\\n present position through consistent hard work and racklike\\n vill power. Itwas indeed an exceptionally talented team.\\n \\x0c\\x0cThrusters\\n \\n aving taken up the leadership of executing the SLV-3\\n \\n araect, faced ugert and corflting demands an my time\\n work, material procurement,\\n \\n coresponde\\n \\n reviows, briefings, ane for he reed to be informed on a\\n \\n wide range of subject\\n \\n My day would Strtwitha srl of about? ken around the\\n lodge I was living in. used fo prepare a general schedule\\n during my morning walk, and emphasize two or three things\\n I would definitely ike to accomplish during the day\\n including at least one thing that would help achieve long-\\n term goals.\\n \\n Once in the office, Iwould clean the table first.

Then | would put the high\\n priority papers in front of me and everything else out of\\n sight.\\n \\n Coming back to SLV-3, about 250 sub-assemblies and\\n 44 major subsystems were conceived during the design.\\n The list of materials went up to over { milion components.\\n A project implementation strategy had become essential to.\\n achieve sustained ability of this complex programme of\\n seven to ten years’ duration. From his side, Prof. Dhawan\\n came up with a clear statement that all the manpower and\\n funds at VSSC and SHAR would have to be directed to us.\\n From our side, we evolved a matrix type of management to\\n achieve productive interfacing with more than 300\\n industries. The target was that our interaction with them\\n must lead to their technology empowerment. Three things |\\n stressed before my colleagues—importance of design\\n capability, goal setting and realisation, and the strength to\\n withstand setbacks. Now, before | dwell on the finer\\n aspects of the management of the SLV-3 project, let me\\n talk about the SLV-3 itself.\\n \\n I is interesting to describe a launch vehicle\\n anthropomorphically, The main mechanical structure may\\n be visualized as the body of a human being, the control and\\n guidance systems with their associated electronics\\n constitute the brain. The musculature comes from\\n propellants. How are they made? What are the materials,\\n and techniques involved?\\n \\n A large variety of materials go into the making of a\\n launch vehicle— both metalic and non-metalic, which\\n include composites and ceramics. h metals, different types\\n of stainless steel, alloys of aluminium, magnesium, titanium,\\n copper, berylium, tungsten and molysdenum are used\\n Composite materials are composed of a mixture or\\n combination of two or more constituents which differ in form\\n and material composition and which are essentially\\n insoluble in one another. The materials which combine may\\n be metallic, organic or inorganic. While other material\\n combinations possible are virtually unlimited, the most\\n typical composites in launch vehicles are made of structural\\n constituents, embedded in a matrix We used a lage\\n variety of glass fibre reinforced plastic composites and\\n ‘opened avenues for the entry of Kevlar, polyamides and\\n carbon-carbon composites. Ceramics are special types of\\n baked clay used for microwave transparent enclosures. We\\n considered using ceramics, but had to reject the idea then\\n due to technological limitations.\\n \\x0crough mechanical engineering, these materials are\\n transformed into hardware. In fact, of all the engineering\\n disciplines which feed directly into the development of\\n rocketry, mechanical engineering is perhaps the most\\n intinsic one. Be it a sophisticated system like a liquid\\n engine or a piece of hardware as simple as a fastener, its\\n ultimate fabrication calls for expert mechanical engineers\\n and precision machine tools. We decided to develop\\n important technologies like welding techniques for lowalloy\\n stainless steel, electroforming techniques, and ulta-\\n precision process tooling. We also decided to make some\\n important machines in-house, like the 254Jlire vertical\\n mixer and the groove machining facility for our third and\\n fourth stages. Many of our subsystems were so massive\\n and complex that they implied sizeable financial outays.\\n Without any hesitation, we approached industries in the\\n private sector and developed contract management plans\\n which later became blueprints for many govemmentrun\\n science and technology business organizations\\n \\n Coming to the life part of the SLY, there is the complex\\n electical circuitry, which sets the mechanical structure in\\n motion. This vast spectrum of activities, encompassing\\n simple electrical power supplies to sophisticated\\n instrumentation as well as guidance and control systems is\\n collectively referred to in aerospace research as ‘Avionics’\\n Development efforts in avionic systems had already been\\n initiated at VSSC in the field of digital electronics,\\n microwave radars and radar transponders, and inertial\\n components and systems. It is very important to know the\\n state of the SLV when it is in fight. SLV brought a new\\n surge of activity in the development of a variety of\\n transducers for measurement of physical parameters ike\\n pressure, thrust, vibration, acceleration, etc. The\\n transducers convert the physical parameters of the vehicle\\n into electrical signals. An on-board telemetry system\\n processes these signals suitably and transmits them in the\\n form of radio signals to the ground stations, where they are\\n received and deciphered back to the original information\\n collected by the transducers. if the systems work according\\n fo design there is litte cause for concern; but in case\\n something goes wrong, the vehicle must be destroyed to\\n stop it from making any unexpected moves. To ensure\\n safety, a special tele-command system was made to\\n destroy the rocket in case it malfunctions, and an\\n interferrometer system was developed to determine the\\n range and position of the SLV, as a added means to the\\n radar system. The SLV project also initiated the indigenous\\n production of sequencers which time the various events,\\n such as ignition, stage separation, vehicle altitude\\n programmers which store the information for the rocket\\n manoeuwes, and auto-pilot electronics which take\\n appropriate decisions to steer the rocket along its\\n predetermined path\\n \\n Without the energy to propel the whole system, a launch\\n vehicle remains grounded. A propellant is usually a\\n combustible substance that produces heat and supplies\\n ejection particles in a rocket engine. Ris both a source of\\n energy and a working substance for expanding energy.\\n Because the distinction is more decisive in rocket engines,\\n the term propellant is used primarily to describe chemicals\\n carried by rockets for propulsive purposes.\\n \\n Kis customary to classify propellants as either solids or\\n liquids. We concentrated on solid propellants. A solid\\n propellant consists essentially of three components: the\\n oxidizer, the fuel and the additives. Solid propellants are\\n further classified into two types: composite and double\\n \\x0cbase. The former consists of an oxidizer or inorganic\\n material (ike ammonium perchlorate) in a matrix of organic\\n fuel (ike synthetic rubber). Double base propellants were\\n distant dreams those days but nevertheless we dared to\\n dream about them.\\n \\n All this self sufficiency and indigenous manufacture\\n came gradually, and not ahvays without pain. We were a\\n team of almost selftrained engineers. In retrospect I feel\\n the unique blend of our untutored talent, character, and\\n dedication suited SLV development the most. Problems\\n surfaced regularly and almost consistently. But my team\\n members never exhausted my patience. I recall writing after\\n winding up a late night shift\\n \\n Beautiful hands are those that do\\n Work that is eamest and brave and tue\\n Moment by moment\\n The fong day through.\\n \\n Almost parallel to our work on SLV, the DRDO was\\n preparing itself for developing an indigenous surface-to-air\\n missile. The RATO project was abandoned because the\\n aircraft for which it was designed became obsolete. The\\n new aircraft did not need RATO. With the project called off,\\n Narayanan was DRDO\\'s logical choice to lead the team for\\n making the missile. Unlike us at ISRO, they preferred the\\n philosophy of one-toone substitution rather than technology\\n development and performance upgrading. The Surface-to-\\n Air Missile SA-2 of Russian origin was chosen to acquire\\n detailed knowledge of all the design parameters of a\\n proven missile and to establish, thereby, the necessary\\n infrastructure required in the organization. was. thot\\n that once one-to-one indigenization was established,\\n further advances in the sophisticated fleld of guided\\n missiles would be a natural falkout. The project was\\n sanctioned in February 1972 with the code name Devil and\\n funding of about Rs. 5 crore was made available for the first\\n three years. Aimost half of itwas to go in foreign exchange.\\n \\n By now promoted to Air Commodore, Narayanan took\\n over as Director, DRDL. He mobilized this young laboratory\\n located in the southeastern suburbs of Hyderabad to take\\n up this enormous task. The landscape dotted with tombs\\n and old buildings started reverberating with new life.\\n Narayanan was a man of tremendous energy—a man\\n always in the boost phase. He gathered around him a\\n strong group of enthusiastic people, drawing many service\\n officers into this predominantly civilian laboratory. Totally\\n preoccupied with the SLY affairs, my participation in the\\n Missile Panel meetings gradually dwindled, and then\\n stopped altogether. However, stories about Narayanan and\\n his Devil were beginning to reach Trivandrum. A\\n transformation of an unprecedented scale was taking place\\n there.\\n \\n During my association with Narayanan in the RATO\\n project, | had discovered that he was a hard taskmaster—\\n ‘one who went all out for control, mastery and domination. 1\\n used fo wonder if managers lke him, who aim at getting\\n results no matter what the price, would face a rebellion of\\n silence and non-cooperation in the long run.\\n \\n New Year\\'s day, 1975, brought with it an opportunity to\\n have a firstperson assessment of the work going on under\\n Narayanan’s leadership. Prof MGK Menon, who was\\n working then as Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister\\n and was head of the DRDO, appointed a review committee\\n under the chairmanship of Dr Brahm Prakash to evaluate\\n the work carried outin the Devil Project. Iwas taken into the\\n team as a rocket specialist to evaluate the progress made.\\n \\x0cin the areas of aerodynamics, structure and propulsion of\\n the missile. On the propulsion aspects, | was assisted by\\n BR Somasekhar and by Wg Cdr P Kamaraju. The\\n committee members included Dr RF Shenoy and Prof. IG\\n Sarma who were to review the work done on the electronic\\n systems.\\n We met at DRDL on 1 and 2 January 1975, folowed by\\n a second session after about six weeks. We visited the\\n various development work centres and held discussions\\n with the scientists there. Iwas greatly impressed by the\\n vision of AV Ranga Rao, the dynamism of Wg Cdr R\\n Gopalaswami, the thoroughness of Dr | Achyuta Rao, the\\n enterprise of G Ganesan, S Krishnan\\'s clarity of thought\\n and R Balakrishnan\\'s critical eye for detail, The calm of JC\\n Bhattacharya and Lt Col R Swaminathan in the face of\\n immense complexities was striking. The zeal and\\n application of Lt Col VJ Sundaram was conspicuous. They\\n were a biiliant, committed group of people—a mix of\\n sence officers and civilian scientists—who had tained\\n themselves in the areas of their own interest out of their\\n driving urge to fly an Indian missile.\\n \\n We had our concluding meeting towards the end of\\n March 1975 at Trivandrum. We felt that the progress in the\\n execution of the project was adequate in respect of\\n hardware fabrication to carry out the philosophy of one-to-\\n ‘one substitution of missile subsystems exceptin the liquid\\n rocket area, where some more time was required to\\n succeed. The committee was of the unanimous opinion that\\n DRDL had achieved the twin goals of hardware fabrication\\n and system analysis creditably in the design and\\n development of the ground electronics complex assigned\\n to them.\\n \\n We observed that the one-to-one — substitution\\n philosophy had taken precedence over the generation of\\n design data. Consequently, many design engineers had not\\n been able to pay adequate attention to the necessary\\n analysis which was the practice folowed by us at VSSC.\\n ‘The system analysis studies camied out up to then had also\\n been only of @ preliminary nature. hall, the resuits\\n accomplished were outstanding, but we still had a long way\\n 0 go. Irecalled a school poem:\\n \\n Dont worry and fret, fainthearted,\\n \\n The chances have just begun,\\n For the bestjobs havent been started,\\n The best work hasnt been done.\\n \\n The committee made a strong recommendation to the\\n Government to give Devil a further go-ahead. Our\\n recommendation was accepted and the project proceeded\\n \\n Back home at VSSC, SLV was taking shape. h\\n contrast fo the DRDL which was sprinting ahead, we were\\n moving slowly Instead of following the leader, my team was\\n trekking towards success on several individual paths. The\\n essence of our method of work was an emphasis on\\n communication, particuiarly in the lateral direction, among\\n the teams and within the teams. In a way, communication\\n was my mantra for managing this gigantic project. To get\\n the best from my team members, | spoke to them frequently\\n ‘on the goals and objectives of the organization,\\n emphasizing the importance of each member\\'s specific\\n contribution towards the realisation of these goals. At the\\n same time, I tried to be receptive to every constructive idea\\n emanating from my subordinates and to relay it in an\\n appropriate form for critical. examination and\\n implementation. [had written somewhere in my diary of that\\n \\n Serio\\n \\x0c# you want to leave your footprints\\n Onthe sands of ime\\n Do not diag your feet\\n the time, communication gets confused with\\n \\n conversation. In fact, the two are distnety different. | was\\n (and am) a terrible conversationalist but consider myself a\\n good communicator. A conversation ful of pleasanties is\\n most offen devoid of any useful information, whereas\\n communication is meant only for the exchange of\\n information. It is very important to realise that\\n communication is a twoparty affair which aims at passing\\n ‘on or receiving a specific piece of information.\\n \\n ile working on the SLV, | used communication to\\n promote understanding and to come to an agreement with\\n colleagues in defining the problems that existed and in\\n identifying the action necessary to be taken to solve them\\n Authentic communication was one of the tools skifully used\\n in managing the project. How did Ido that? To begin with, I\\n tried to be factual and never sugar-coated the bitter pill of\\n facts. At one of the Space Science Council (SSC) review\\n meetings, frustrated by the procurement delays, | erupted\\n info an agitated complaint against the indifference and red-\\n tape tactics of the controller of accounts and financial\\n advisor of VSSC. | insisted that the systems of work\\n followed by the accounts staff had to change and\\n demanded the delegation of their functions to the project\\n team. Dr Brahm Prakash was taken aback by the bluntness\\n ‘of my submission. He stubbed out his cigarette and walked\\n ‘out of the meeting,\\n \\n Ispent the whole night regretting the pain my harsh\\n words had caused Dr Brahm Prakash. However, | was\\n determined to fight the inertia built into the system before |\\n found myself being dragged down with it. asked myself a\\n practical question: could one live with these insensitive\\n bureaucrats? The answer was a big no. Then I asked\\n myself a private question: what would hurt Dr Brahm\\n Prakash more, my seemingly harsh words now, or the\\n burial of the SLV at a later stage? Finding my head and\\n heart agreeing, Iprayed to God for help. Fortunately for me,\\n Dr Brahm Prakash delegated financial powers to the\\n project the next moming.\\n \\n Anyone who has taken up the responsibility to lead a\\n team can be successfil only if he is sufficiently\\n independent, powerful and influential in his own fight to\\n become a person to reckon with. This is perhaps also the\\n path to individual satisfaction in life, for freedom with\\n responsibility is the only sound basis for personal\\n happiness. What can one do to strengthen personal\\n freedom? | would like to share with you two techniques |\\n adopt in this regard\\n \\n First, by building your own education and skills.\\n Knowledge is a tangible asset, quite often the most\\n important tool in your work. The more up-to-date the\\n knowledge you possess, the freer you are. Knowledge\\n cannot be taken away from anyone except by\\n obsolescence. A leader can only be free to lead his team if\\n he keeps abreast of all that is happening around him—in\\n real time. To lead, in a way, is to engage in continuing\\n education. In many counties, it is normal for professionals,\\n fo go to college several nights every week. To be a\\n successful team leader, one has to stay back affer the din\\n and clutter of a working day to emerge better-equipped and\\n ready to face a new day,\\n \\n ‘The second way is to develop a passion for personal\\n responsibilty, The sovereign way to personal freedom is to\\n \\x0chelp determine the forces that determine you. Be active!\\n Take on responsibility! Work for the things you believe in. If\\n you do not, you are surrendering your fate to others. The\\n fistoian Edith Hamitton wrote of ancient Greece, “When\\n the freedom they wished for most was freedom from\\n responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free and was\\n never free again’. The truth is that there is a great deal that\\n most of us can individually do to increase our freedom. We\\n can combat the forces that threaten to oppress us. We can\\n fortify ourselves with the qualites and conditions that\\n promote individual freedom. In doing so, we help to create\\n \\n stonger organization, capable of achieving\\n Unprecedented goals.\\n \\n As work on the SLV gained momentum, Prof. Dhawan\\n introduced the system of reviewing progress with the entire\\n team involved in the project Prof. Dhawan was a man with\\n a mission. He would effortlessly pull together all the loose\\n ends to make work move smoothly At VSSC the review\\n meetings presided over by Prof. Dhawan used to he\\n considered major events. He was a true captain of the\\n ISRO ship—a commander, navigator, housekeeper, all\\n rolled into one. Yet, he never pretended to know more than\\n he did. stead, when something appeared ambiguous, he\\n would ask questions and discuss his doubts frankly. |\\n remember him as a leader for whom to lead with a firm, but\\n fair hand, was @ moral compulsion. His mind used to be\\n very firm once it had been decided on anyissue. But before\\n taking a decision, it used to be like clay, open to\\n impressions unt the final moulding. Then the decisions\\n would be popped into the potter\\'s oven for glazing, never\\n failing to emerge hard and tough, resistant and enduring\\n \\n Thad the privilege of spending a great deal of time with\\n Prof. Dhawan. He could hold the listener enthralled\\n because of the logical, intellectual acumen he could bring to\\n bear on his analysis of any subject. He had an unusual\\n combination of degrees—a B.Sc. in Mathematics and\\n Physics, an M.A. in English Literature, B.E. in Mechanical\\n Engineering, M.S. in Aeronautical Engineering followed by\\n \\n PhD. in Aeronautics and Mathematics from the\\n California hnstitute of Technology (Cattech) in USA.\\n \\n htellectual debates with him were very stimulating and\\n could always mentally energize me and my team members,\\n found him full of optimism and compassion. Although he\\n ‘often judged himself harshly, with no allowances or\\n excuses, he was generous to a faultwhen it came to others.\\n Prof. Dhawan used to stemly pronounce his judgements\\n and then pardon the contite guilty parties.\\n \\n h 1975, ISRO became a government body, An ISRO\\n council was formed consisting of Directors of different work\\n centres and senior officers in the Department of Space\\n (DoS). This provided a symbolic link as well asa forum for\\n participative management between the DoS which had the\\n Governmental powers and the centres which would execute\\n the jobs. In the traditional parlance of Govemment\\n departments, ISRO\\'s centres would have been subordinate\\n units of attached offices, but such words were never\\n spoken either at ISRO or DoS. Participative management,\\n which calls for active interaction between those who wield\\n administrative powers and the executing agencies, was a\\n novel feature of ISRO management that would go a long\\n wayin hdian R&D organizations.\\n \\n ‘The new setup brought me in contact with TN Seshan,\\n the Joint Secretary in the DoS. Til then, I had a latent\\n reservation about bureaucrats, so | was not very\\n comfortable when I first saw Seshan participating in a SLV-\\n 3 Management Board meeting. But soon, it changed to\\n \\x0cadmiration for Seshan, who would meticulously go through\\n the agenda and always come for the meetings prepared.\\n He used to kindle the minds of scientists with his\\n ‘tremendous analytical capability\\n \\n ‘The first three years of the SLV project was the period\\n for the revelation of many fascinating mysteries of science.\\n Being human, ignorance has always been with us, and\\n always will be. What was new was my awareness of it, my\\n awakening to its fathomless dimensions. | used to\\n erroneously suppose that the function of science was to\\n explain everything, and that unexplained phenomena were\\n the province of people like my father and Lakshmana\\n Sastry. However, | always refrained from discussing these\\n matters with any of my scientist colleagues, fearing that it\\n would threaten the hegemony of their meticulously formed\\n \\n ews.\\n Gradually, | became aware of the difference between\\n science and technology, between research and\\n development. Science is inherently open-ended and\\n exploratory. Development is a closed loop. Mistakes are\\n imperative in development and are made every day, but\\n each mistake is used for modification, upgradation or\\n betterment Probably, the Creator created engineers to\\n make scientists achieve more. For each time scientists\\n thoroughly researched and fully\\n comprehended soliton, engineers show them yet another\\n lumineu, yet one more possibility | cautioned my team\\n against becoming scientists. Science is a passion—a\\n never-ending voyage into promises and possibilities. We\\n had only limited time and limited funds. Our making the\\n SLV depended upon our awareness of our own limits.\\n preferred existing workable solutions which would be the\\n best options. Nothing that is new comes into time-bound\\n projects without its own problems. In my opinion, a project\\n leader should always work with proven technologies in\\n most of the systems as far as possible and experiment only\\n from multiple resources.\\n \\x0c\\x0cExpedients\\n \\n The SLV-3 project had been formulated in such a way\\n that the major technology work centres, both at VSSC and\\n at SHAR could handle propellant production, rocket motor\\n testing and launch of any large diameter rocket. As\\n participants in the SLV-3 project, we set three milestones\\n for ourselves: development and fight qualification of all\\n subsystems through sounding rackets by 1975; sub-orbital\\n fights by 1976; and the final orbital fight in 1978. The work\\n tempo had picked up now and the atmosphere was\\n charged with excitement. Wherever | went, our teams had\\n something interesting to show me. A large number of things\\n were being done for the first ime in the country and the\\n gfoundievel technicians had had no prior exposure to this\\n kind of work. I saw new performance dimensions growing\\n among my team members.\\n \\n Performance dimensions are factors that lead to\\n creation, They go beyond competencies such as the skills\\n and knowledge of the individual. Performance dimensions\\n are broader and deeper than what a person mustknow and\\n be able to do in order to function well in his or her job. They\\n include attitudes, values and character traits. They exist at\\n various levels of the human personality. At the behavioural\\n level—at the outermost ring of the tree—we can observe\\n skills and measure knowedge. Social roles and self-image\\n dimensions are found at the intermediate level. Motives,\\n and traits exist at the innermost or core level. If we can\\n \\n together to form a blueprint for outstanding performance in\\n both thought and action.\\n \\n Although SLV-3 was still in the future, its subsystems\\n were being completed. h June 1974, we used the Centaur\\n sounding rocket launch to test some of our critical systems.\\n A scaled down heat shield of SLV, Rate Gyro Unit, and\\n Vehicle Attitude Programmer were integrated into the\\n Centaur rocket. The three systems involved wide-ranging\\n expertise— composite materials, contral engineering and\\n software, none of them ever having been tried before in the\\n county. The test was @ complete success. Until then the\\n Indian Space Programme had not gone beyond sounding\\n rockets and even knowledgeable people were not ready to\\n see and acknowledge its efforts as anything more serious,\\n than fidding around with meteorological instruments. For\\n the first time, we inspired the confidence of the nation.\\n Prime Minister hidira Gandhi told Parliament on 24 July\\n 1974, “The development and fabrication of relevant\\n technologies, subsystems and hardware (to make India\\'s\\n first Satelite Launch Vehicle) are progressing satisfactorily\\n Avnumber of industries are engaged in the fabricaton of\\n components. The first orbital fight by India is scheduled to\\n take place in 1978.\"\\n \\n Like any other act of creation, the creation of the SLV-3\\n also had its painful moments. One day, when my team and |\\n were totally engrossed in the preparation of the static test\\n of the first stage motor, the news of a death in the family\\n reached me. My brotherin-law and mentor Jenab Ahmed\\n Jallaludin, was no more. For a couple of minutes, | was\\n immobilized, | could not think, could not feel anything. When\\n Icouid focus on my surroundings once more and attempted\\n to participate in the work, found myself talking incoherently\\n —and then Irealised that, with Jalaluddin, a part of me had\\n passed away too. A vision of my childhood reappeared\\n before me—evening waks around the Rameswaram\\n \\x0ctemple, shining sand and dancing tides in the moonlight,\\n stars looking down from an unlit sky on a new moon right,\\n Jallaluddin showing me the horizon sinking into the sea,\\n arranging money for my books, and seeing me off at Santa\\n Cruz airport. [felt that | had been thrown into a whirlpool of\\n time and space. My father, by now more than a hundred\\n years old, pallbearer for his son-in-law, who had been half\\n his age; the bereft soul of my sister Zohara, her wounds\\n from the loss of her four-year-old son stil raw—these\\n images came before my eyes in a blur, too terible for me\\n fo comprehend. I leaned on the assembly jig, composed\\n myself and left a few instructions with Dr S Srinivasan,\\n Deputy Project Director, to camry on with the work in my\\n absence\\n \\n Travelling ovemight in a combination of distict buses, |\\n reached Rameswaram only the next day. During this time, |\\n did my best to free myself from the very past which\\n appeared to have come fo an end with Jalaluddin, But the\\n moment I reached my house, grief assailed me afresh. |\\n had no words for Zohara or for my niece Mehboob, both of\\n whom were crying uncontrollably. I had no tears to shed\\n We sorrowful put Jallaluddin\\'s body to rest.\\n \\n My father held my hands for @ long time. There were no\\n tears in his eyes either. “Do you not see, Abul, howthe Lord\\n lengthens the shadows? Had it been His will, He could have\\n made them constant. But He makes the sun their guide,\\n lite by little He shortens them. It is He who has made the\\n right a mantle for you, and sleep a rest. Jallaluddin has\\n gone into @ long sleep—a dreamless sleep, a complete\\n rest of all his being within simple unconsciousness. Nothing\\n will befall us except what Allah has ordained. He is our\\n Guardian. In Allah, my son, put your trust He slowly closed\\n his wrinkled eyelids and went into a trance-like state.\\n \\n Death has never fightened me. After all, everyone has\\n fo go one day. But perhaps Jallaluddin went a litle too\\n early, a little too soon. I could not bring myself to stay for\\n long at home. Heit the whole of my inner self drowning ina\\n sort of arvéous agitation, and inner conflicts between my\\n personal and my professional ife. For many days, back in\\n Thumba, Heit a sense of futlity |had never known before—\\n about everything Iwas doing.\\n \\n Thad long talks with Prof. Dhawan. He told me that my\\n progress on the SLV project would bring me solace. The\\n confusion would first lessen and would later pass away\\n altogether. He drew my altenion to the wonders of\\n technology and its achievements.\\n \\n Gradually, the hardware began emerging from the\\n drawing boards. Sasi Kumar built a very effective network\\n of fabrication work centres. Within days of getting a\\n component drawing, he would embark on the fabrication\\n with what was available. Namboodiri and Pillai were\\n spending their days and nights at the propulsion laboratory\\n developing four rocket motors simultaneous. MSR Dev\\n and Sandias drew up meticulous plans for mechanical and\\n electical integration of the vehicle. Madhavan Nair and\\n Murthy examined the systems developed by the VSSC\\n electronics laboratories and engineered them into flight\\n Sub- systems wherever it was possible. US Singh brought\\n up the first launch ground system, comprising of telemetry,\\n tele-command, and radar. He also chalked out a detailed\\n work plan with SHAR for the fight trials. Dr Sundararajan\\n closely monitored mission objectives and concurrently\\n updated the systems. Dr Srinivasan, a competent launch\\n vehicle designer, discharged all my complementary and\\n supplementary functions as the SLV deputy project\\n director He noticed what | had overlooked. heard the\\n \\x0cpoints | failed to listen to, and suggested possibilities that |\\n had not so much as visualized\\n \\n We learned the hard way that the biggest problem of\\n project management is to achieve a regular and efficient\\n interfacing between the different individuals and work\\n centres. Hard work can be set at nought in the absence of\\n proper coordination.\\n \\n d the fortune of having YS Rajan from the ISRO\\n headquarters as my friend in those times. Rajan was (and\\n is) a universal friend. His fiiendship embraced with equal\\n wamnth turers, fiters, electricians and drivers as well as\\n scientists, engineers, contractors and bureaucrats. Today\\n when the press calls me a ‘welder of people’, latribute this\\n to Rajan. His close interaction with different work centres\\n created such a harmony in SLV affairs that the fine threads\\n of individual efforts were woven into a mighty fabric of great\\n strength.\\n \\n h 1976, my father passed away. He had been in poor\\n health for quite some time due to his advanced age. The\\n death of Jalaluddin had also taken a toll on his health and\\n spirit. He had lost his desire to live, as though after seeing\\n Jallaluddin return to his divine source, he too had become\\n eager to return to his.\\n \\n ‘Whenever | leamt about my father\\'s indifferent health, |\\n would visit Rameswaram with a good city doctor Every\\n time I did so, he would chide me for my unnecessary\\n concer and lecture me on the expenses incurred on the\\n doctor. “Your visit is enough for me to get well, why bring a\\n doctor and spend money on his fees?\" he would ask. This,\\n time he had gone beyond the capabilites of any doctor,\\n care or money. My father Jainulabdeen, who had lived on\\n Rameswaram island for 102 years, had passed away\\n leaving betind fifteen grandchildren and\\n greatgrandson, He had led an exemplary life. Sitting alone,\\n ‘on the night after the burial, | remembered a poem written\\n ‘on the death of Yeats by his friend Auden, and felt as if it\\n wes writen for my father:\\n \\n Earth, receive an honoured guest;\\n Vitiam Yeats is laid to rest:\\n \\n  \\n \\n tn the prison of his days Teach the\\n free man howto praise.\\n \\n hwortdly terms, itwas the death of ust another old man.\\n No public mouming was organized, no flags were lowered\\n to half-mast, no newspaper carried an obituary for him. He\\n ‘was nota politician, a scholar, ora businessman. He was @\\n plain and transparent man. My father pursued the supreme\\n value, the Good. His life inspired the growth of all that was\\n benign and angelic, wise and noble.\\n \\n My father had always reminded me of the legendary\\n Abou Ben Adhem who, waking one night from a deep\\n dream of peace, saw an angel witing in a book of gold the\\n names of those who love the Lord. Abou asked the Angel if\\n his own name was on the list. The Angel replied in the\\n negative. Disappointed but still cheerful, Abou said, “Write\\n my name down as one that loves his fellowmen’. The angel\\n wrote, and vanished. The next night, it came again with a\\n great wakening light, and showed the names of those\\n whom the love of God had blessed. And Abou\\'s name was\\n the first on the list.\\n \\n Isatfor a long time with my mother, but could not speak.\\n She blessed me ina choked voice when I took leave of her\\n fo return to Thumba. She knew that she was notto leave the\\n house of her husband, of which she was the custodian, and\\n Iwas notto live with her there. Both of us had to live out our\\n \\x0cown destinies. Was | too stubbom or was | excessively\\n preoccupied with the SLV? Should I not have forgotten for a\\n while my own affairs in order to listen to her? | regretfully\\n realised this only when she passed away soon aftenwards.\\n \\n The SLV-3 Apogee rocket, developed as a common\\n upper stage with Diamont, scheduled to be fight tested in\\n France was mired in a series of knotty problems. | had to\\n rush to France to sort them out. Before I could depart, late\\n inthe affemoon, Iwas informed that my mother had passed\\n away. [took the first available bus to Nagarcail. From there,\\n Itavelled to Rameswaram spending a whole night in the\\n train and performed the last rites the next morning. Both the\\n people who had formed me had left for their heavenly\\n abode. The departed had reached the end of their journey.\\n ‘The rest of us had to continue walking the weary road and\\n life had to go on. I prayed in the mosque my father had\\n ‘once taken me to every evening. [told Him that my mother\\n could not have lived longer in the world without the care and\\n love of her husband, and therefore had preferred to join\\n him. I begged His forgiveness. “They carried out the task |\\n designed for them with great care, dedication and honesty\\n and came back to me. Why are you mouming their day of\\n accomplishment? Concentrate on the assignments that lie\\n before you, and prociaim my glory through your deeds!\"\\n Nobody had said these words, but I heard them loud and\\n clear. An inspiring aphorism in the Qur\\'an on the passing\\n away of souls filed my mind: “Your wealth and children are\\n only a temptation whereas: Allah! with Him is an etemal\\n award.\" | came out of the mosque with my mind at peace\\n and proceeded to the railway station, | always remember\\n that when the call for namaz sounded, our home would\\n transform into a small mosque. My father and my mother\\n leading, and their children and grandchildren following\\n \\n next morning I was back at Thumba, physically\\n \\n exhausted, emotionally shattered, but detemined to fulfil\\n ‘our ambition of fying an hdian rocket motor on foreign soil\\n \\n On my return from France, after successfully testing the\\n SLV-3 apogee motor, Dr Brahm Prakash informed me one\\n day about the arrival of Wernher von Braun. Everybody\\n working in rocketry knows of von Braun, who made the\\n lethal V-2 missiles that devastated London in the Second\\n World War. h the final stages of the War, von Braun was\\n captured by the Allied Forces. As a tibute to his genius,\\n von Braun was given a top position in the rocketry\\n programme at NASA. Working for the US Army, von Braun\\n produced the landmark Jupiter missile, which was the first\\n REM with a 3000 km range. When | was asked by Dr\\n Brahm Prakash to receive von Braun at Madras and escort\\n him to Thumba, Iwas naturally excited\\n \\n The V-2 missile (an abbreviation of the Geman word\\n Vergeltungswaffe) was by far the greatest single\\n achievement in the fistory of rackets and missiles. It was\\n the culmination of the efforts made by von Braun and his\\n team in the VFR (Society for Space Flight) in the 1920s.\\n Whathad begun as a civilian effort soon became an official\\n amy one, and von Braun became the technical director of\\n the German Missile Laboratory at Kummersdort. The first\\n \\\\-2 missile was first tested unsuccessfully in June 1942. tt\\n toppled over on to its side and exploded. But on 16 August\\n 1942, it became the first missile to exceed the speed of\\n sound. Under the supervision of von Braun, more than\\n 10,000 V-2 missiles were produced between April and\\n October 1944 at the gigantic underground production unit\\n near Nordhausen in Germany. That | would be travelling\\n with this man—a scientist, a designer, a production\\n engineer, an administrator, a technology manager all rolled\\n \\x0cinto one—what more could Ihave asked for?\\n \\n We flew in an Avro aircraft which took around ninety\\n minutes from Madras to Trivandrum. von Braun asked me\\n about our work and listened as if he was just another\\n student of rocketry, I never expected the father of modem\\n rocketry to be so humble, receptive and encouraging. He\\n made me feel comfortable right through the flight. It was\\n hard to imagine that | was talking to a giant of missile\\n systems, as he was so selfeffaci\\n \\n He observed that the length to diameter LID ratio of the\\n SLV3, which was designed to be 22 was on the higher side\\n and cautioned me about the aero-elastic problems which\\n must be avoided during fight\\n \\n Having spent the major part of his working life in\\n Germany, how did he feel in America? asked this of von\\n Braun who had become a cult figure in the States after\\n creating the Saturn racket in the Apolo mission which put\\n man on the moon. “America is a county of great\\n possibilities, but they look upon everything un-American\\n with suspicion and contempt. They suffer from a deep-\\n rooted NIH—Not Invented Here—complex and look down\\n on alien technologies. if you want to do anything in rocketry,\\n do it yourself\" von Braun advised me. He commented,\\n ‘SLV-3 is a genuine Indian design and you may be having\\n your own troubles. But you should always remember thatwe\\n don\\'tjust build on successes, we also build on failures.\"\\n \\n On the topic of the inevitable hard work that goes with\\n rocket development and the degree of commitment\\n involved, he smiled and said with a glint of mischief in his\\n eyes, “Hard work is not enough in rocketry, itis not a sport\\n where mere hard work can fetch you honours. Here, not\\n only do you have to have a goal but you have to have\\n strategies to achieve itas fast as possible.\"\\n \\n ‘Total commitment is not just hard work, it is total\\n involvement. Building @ rock wall is back-breaking work,\\n There are some people who build rack walls all their lives.\\n And when they die, there are miles of walls, mute\\n testimonials to how hard those people had worked.\"\\n \\n He continued, “But there are other men who while\\n placing one rock on top of another have a vision in their\\n minds, a goal. may be a terrace with roses climbing over\\n the rock walls and chairs set out for lazy summer days. Or\\n the rock wall may enclose an apple orchard or mark a\\n boundary. When they finish, they have more than a wall. tis\\n the goal that makes the difference. Do not make rocketry\\n your profession, your livelinood— make it your religion, your\\n mission.\" Did I see something of Prof. Vikram Sarabhai in\\n von Braun? It made me happy to think so.\\n \\n With three deaths in the family in as many successive\\n years, | needed total commitment to my work in order to.\\n keep performing. I wanted to throw all my being into the\\n creation of the SLV. | felt as if |had discovered the path |\\n ‘was meantto follow, God\\'s mission for me and my purpose\\n ‘on His earth. During this period, it was as though I had\\n pushed a hold button—no badminton in the evenings, no\\n more weekends or holidays, no family, no relations, not\\n even any friends outside the SLV circle.\\n \\n To succeed in your mission, you must have single-\\n minded devotion to your goal. Individuals like myseff are\\n often called ‘workaholics\\'. I question this term because that\\n implies @ pathological condition or an iliness. FI do that\\n which I desire more than anything else in the world and\\n which makes me happy, such work can never be an\\n aberration. Words from the twenty-sixth Psaim come to\\n mind while work: “Examine me, © Lord, and prove me.\"\\n \\x0cTotal commitment is a crucial quality for those who want\\n to reach the very top of their profession. The desire to work\\n at optimum capacity leaves hardly any room for anything\\n else. Ihave had people with me who would scoff at the 40-\\n hours-a-week job they were being paid for. I have known\\n ‘others who used to work 60, 80 and even 100 hours a\\n week because they found their work exciting and\\n rewarding. Total commitment is the common denominator\\n among all successful men and women. Are you able to\\n manage the stresses you encounter in your life? The\\n difference between an energetic and a confused person is,\\n the difference in the way their minds handie their\\n experiences. Man needs his difficulties because they are\\n necessary to enjoy success. All of us carry some sort of a\\n super inteligence within us. Let it be stimulated to enable\\n us to examine our deepest thoughts, desires, and beliefs.\\n \\n Once you have done this—charged yourself, as it were,\\n vith your commitment fo your work—you also need good\\n health and boundless energy. Climbing to the top demands\\n strength, whether to the top of Mount Everest or to the top of\\n your career. People are born with different energy reserves,\\n and the one who tires first and burns out easily will do well\\n to reorganize his or her life at the earliest\\n \\n hr 1979, a sixmember team was preparing the fight\\n version of a complex second stage control system for static\\n test and evaluation. The team was in countdown mode at T-\\n 15 minutes (15 minutes before the test). One of the twelve\\n valves did not respond during checkout Anvety drove the\\n members of the team to the test site to look into the\\n problem. Suddenly the oxidizer tank, filed with red fuming\\n nitric acid (RFNA), burst, causing severe acid bums to the\\n team members. It was a very traumatic experience to see\\n the suffering of the injured. Kurup and I rushed to the\\n Tivandrum Medical College Hospital and begged to have\\n our colleagues admitted, as six beds were not available in\\n the hospital at that point of time.\\n \\n Sivaramakrishnan Nair was one among the six persons\\n injured. The acid had burned his body at a number of\\n places. By the time we got a bed in the hospital, he was in\\n severe pain. | keptvigil at his bedside. Around 3 o\\' clack in\\n the morning, Sivarama-krishnan regained consciousness.\\n \\n ‘optimism, even in the midst of such severe pain, impressed\\n me deeply.\\n \\n Menlike Sivaramakrishnan are a breed apart They are\\n the strivers, always reaching higher than the last time. And\\n vith their social and family fe welded to their dream, they\\n find the rewards of their drive overwhelming—the inherent\\n joy of being in flow. This event greatly enhanced my\\n confidence in my team; a team that would stand like a rock\\n in success and failure.\\n \\n Ihave used the word ‘flow at many places without really\\n elaborating its meaning. What is this flow? And what are\\n these joys? I could call them moments of magic. I see an\\n analogy between these moments and the high that you\\n experience when you play badminton or go jogging. Flow is,\\n @ sensation we experience when we act with total\\n involvement. During flow, action follows action according to\\n an intemal logic that seems to need no conscious\\n intervention on the part of the worker. There is. no hurry,\\n there are no distracting demands on one\\'s attention. The\\n past and the future disappear. So does the distinction\\n between self and the activity. We had all come under the\\n current of the SLV flow. Although we were working very\\n \\x0chard we were very relaxed, energetic and fresh. How did it\\n happen? Who had created this flow?\\n \\n Perhaps it was the meaningful organization of the\\n purposes we sought to achieve. We would identify the\\n broadest possible purpose level and then work towards,\\n developing a feasible target solution from a variety of\\n alternatives. tt was this working backwards to develop a\\n creative change in the problem solution, that used to put us\\n inflow.\\n \\n When the SLV-3 hardware started emerging, our ability\\n fo concentrate increased markedly, | felt a temendous\\n surge of confidence; in complete control over myself and\\n over the SLV-3 project. Flow is a byproduct of controlled\\n creativity. The first requirement is to work as hard as you\\n can at something that presents a challenge and is\\n approved by your heart. it may not be an overwhelming\\n challenge, but one that stretches you a litte, something that\\n makes you realise that you are performing a task better\\n today than you did yesterday, or the last time you tried to do\\n it. Another prerequisite for being in flow is the availability of\\n a significant span of uninterrupted time. In my experience, it\\n is difficult to switch into the flow state in less than half an\\n hour. And it is almost impossible if you are bedevilled by\\n interruptions.\\n \\n 5 it possible to switch yourself into flow by using some\\n sort of a conditioning device in much the same way that we\\n condition ourselves to learn effectively? The answer is yes,\\n and the secret is to analyse previous occasions when you\\n have been in flow, because each person has his or her\\n unique natural frequency which responds to a particular\\n stimulus. You alone can identify the common denominator\\n in your case. Once you have isolated this common\\n denominator, you can set the stage for flow.\\n \\n Ihave experienced this state many times, almost every\\n day of the SLV mission. There have been days in the\\n laboratory when I have looked up to find the laboratory\\n empty and realised that it was way past the quitting time.\\n On other days, my team members and I have been so\\n caught up in our work that the lunch hour slipped by without\\n ‘our even being conscious that we were hu\\n \\n Analysing such occasions in retrospect, | find them\\n similar in the sense that this flow was experienced when the\\n project was nearing completion, or when the project had\\n reached that phase when all the necessary data had been\\n gathered and we were ready to start summing up the\\n problem, outlining the demands made by conflicting criteria\\n and the various positions presented by opposing interests\\n and making our recommendations for action. lalso realised\\n that this tended to happen on days thatwere relatively quiet\\n in the office, with no ciises or meetings. Such spells\\n increased steadily in frequency, and the SLV-3 dream was\\n finally realised in the middle of 1979.\\n \\n We had scheduled the first experimental fight trial of\\n SLV-3 for 10 August 1979. The primary goals of the\\n mmission were to realise a fully integrated launch vehicle; to\\n evaluate on-board systems like stage motors, guidance\\n and control systems and electronic subsystems; and to\\n evaluate ground systems, ike checkout, tracking, telemetry\\n and realtime data facilites in launch operations built at the\\n Sriharikota launch complex The 23 metre-long, four-stage\\n SLV rocket weighing 17 tonnes finally took off elegantly at\\n 0758 hours and immediately started folowing its,\\n programmed trajectory.\\n \\n Stage | performed to perfection. There was a smooth\\n transition from this stage to the second stage. We were.\\n \\x0cspellbound to see our hopes flying in the form of the SLV-3.\\n Suddenly, the spell was broken. The second stage went out\\n of contol. The fight was terminated after 317 seconds and\\n the vehicle\\'s remains, including my favourite fourth stage\\n with the payload splashed into the sea, 560 km off\\n Sriharikota\\n \\n The incident caused us profound disappointment felt a\\n strange mix of anger and frustration. Suddenly felt my legs\\n become so stiff that they ached. The problem was not with\\n my body; something was happening in my mind\\n \\n The premature death of my hovercraft Nandi, the\\n abandoning of the RATO, the abortion of the SLV-Diamont\\n fourth stage—all came alive in a flash, like a long-buried\\n Phoenix ising from its ashes. Over the years, | had\\n somehow leamed to absorp these aborted endeavours,\\n had come to terms with them and pursued fresh dreams,\\n That day, I re-ived each of those setbacks in my deep\\n despondenoy.\\n \\n ‘What do you suppose could be the cause of it?\"\\n somebody asked me in the Block House. | tried to find an\\n answer, but | was too tired to try and think it out, and gave\\n up the effort as futile. The launch was conducted in the early\\n moming, preceded by a full night\\'s count-down. Moreover, |\\n had hardly had any sleep in the past week. Completely\\n drained—mentally as well as physically went straight to\\n my room and slumped onto the bed.\\n \\n A gentle touch on my shoulder woke me up. Itwas late\\n in the afternoon, almost approaching evening. | saw Dr\\n Brahm Prakash siting by my bedside. “What about going\\n for lunch?\" he asked. Iwas deeply touched by his affection\\n and concern. [found out later that Dr Brahm Prakash had\\n come to my room twice before that but had gone away on\\n finding me asleep. He had waited all that time for me to get\\n up and have lunch with him. Iwas sad, but not alone. The\\n company of Dr Brahm Prakash filled me wih a new\\n confidence. He made light conversation during the meal,\\n carefully avoiding the SLV-3, but gently providing me\\n solace.\\n \\x0c\\x0cBuilders\\n \\n Dr Brahm Prakash helped me endure this difficuit\\n period. In practice, Dr Brahm Prakash employed the front-\\n line damage control principle: ‘Just get the felow home\\n alive. He\\'ll recover.” He drew the entire SLV team close\\n and demonstrated to me that I was not alone in my sorrow\\n at the SLV-3\\'s failure. “All your comrades are standing by\\n you,\" he said. This gave me vital emotional support,\\n encouragement, and guidance.\\n \\n ‘A post-fight review conducted on 11 August 1979 was\\n altended by more than seventy scientists. A detailed\\n technical appraisal of the failure was completed. Later, the\\n postfight analysis committee headed by SK Athithan\\n pinpointed the reasons for the malfunction of the vehicle. It\\n was established that the mishap occurred because of the\\n failure of the second stage control system. No control force\\n was available during the second stage flight due to which\\n the vehicle became aerodynamically unstable, resulting in\\n altitude and velocity loss. This caused the vehicle fo fall into\\n the sea even before the other stages could ignite.\\n \\n Further in-depth analysis of the second-stage failure\\n identified the reason as the draining of a good amount of\\n Red Fuming Nitric Acid (RFNA) used as the oxidizer for the\\n fuel power at that stage. Consequently, when the control\\n force was demanded, only fuel was injected resulting in\\n zero force. \\'A solenoid valve in the oxidizer tank remaining\\n ‘open due fo contamination after the first command at 7:8\\n minutes’, was identified as the reason for the draining of\\n RFNA.\\n \\n The findings were presented to Prof. Dhawan at a\\n meeting of top ISRO scientists and were accepted\\n \\n ody was convinced by the technical cause-and-\\n effect sequence presented and there was a general feeling\\n of satisfacton about the whole exercise of failure-\\n management measures taken. | was still unconvinced\\n though and felt restless. To me, the level of responsibility is,\\n measured by one\\'s ability to confront the decision-making\\n process without any delay or distraction.\\n \\n On the spur of the moment, I stood up and addressed\\n Prof. Dhawan, ‘Sir, even though my friends have technically\\n justified the failure, I take the responsibility for judging the\\n RFNA leak detected during the final phase of countdown as\\n insignificant. As @ Mission Director, I should have put the\\n launch on hold and saved the fight if possible. In a_similar\\n situation abroad, the Mission Director would have lost his,\\n job. I therefore take responsibility for the SLV-3 failure.” For\\n quite some time there was pin-drop silence in the hall. Then\\n \\n Dhawan got up and said, “lam going to put Kalam in\\n obit\", and left the place signalling that the meeting was\\n over.\\n \\n ‘The pursuit of science is a combination of great elation\\n and great despair. I went over many such episodes in my\\n mind. Johannes Kepler, whose three orbital laws form the\\n basis of space research, took nearly 17 years after\\n formulating the two laws about planetary motion around the\\n sun, to enunciate his third law which gives the relation\\n between the size of the eliptical orbit and the length of time\\n it takes for the planet to go around the sun. How many\\n failures and frustrations must he have gone through? The\\n idea that man could land on the moon, developed by the\\n Russian mathematician Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, was\\n realised after nearly four decades—and by the United\\n States, at that. Prof. Chandrasekhar had to wait nearly 50\\n years before receiving the Nobel Prize for his discovery of\\n \\x0cthe ‘Chandrasekhar Limit, a discovery made while he was\\n a graduate student at Cambridge in the 1930s. If his work\\n had been recognized then, it could have led to the\\n discovery of the Black Hole decades earier. How many\\n failures must von Braun have gone through before his\\n Satum launch vehicle put man on the moon? These\\n thoughts helped to give me the ability to withstand\\n apparently irreversible setbacks.\\n \\n Early in November 1979, Dr Brahm Prakash retired. He\\n had always been my sheet-anchor in the turbulent waters of\\n VSSC. His belief in team spirit had inspired the\\n management pattern for the SLV project, which later\\n became a blueprint for all scientific projects in the country.\\n Dr Brahm Prakash was a very wise counsellor who gave\\n me valuable guidance whenever | deviated from my\\n mission objectives.\\n \\n Dr Brahm Prakash not only reinforced the traits which |\\n had acquired from Prof. Saraishai, but also helped me give\\n them new dimensions. He always cautioned me against\\n haste. ‘Big scientific projects are like mountains, which\\n should be climbed with as litle effort as possible and\\n without urgency. The reality of your own nature should\\n determine your speed. If you become restless, speed up. If\\n you become tense and highstrung, slow down. You should\\n climb the mountain in a state of equilibrium. When each\\n task of your project is not just a means to an end but a\\n unique event in itself, then you are doing it well,\" he would\\n tell me. The echo of Dr Brahm Prakash\\'s advice could be\\n heard in Emerson\\'s poem on Brahma:\\n \\n F the red slayer think he slays,\\n \\n Oy, ifthe slain think he is stain,\\n They knownot well, the subtle ways\\n Ikeep, and pass, and tim again.\\n \\n To live only for some unknown future is superficial. itis\\n like climbing a mountain to reach the peak without\\n experiencing its sides. The sides of the mountain sustain\\n life, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience is\\n gained, and technologies are mastered. The importance of\\n the peak lies only n the fact that it defines the sides. So I\\n went on towards the top, but always experiencing the sides.\\n Thad a long way to go but Iwas inno hurry. | went in litle\\n steps—just one step after another—but each step towards\\n \\n Atevery stage, the SLV-3 team was blessed with some\\n extraordinarily courageous people. Along with Sudhakar\\n and Sivaramakrishnan, there was also Sivakaminathan. He\\n was entusted with bringing the C-Band transponder from\\n Tivandrum to SHAR for integration with the SLV-3. The\\n transponder is a device fitted with the rocket system to give\\n the radar signals which are powerful enough to help it track\\n the vehicle from the take-off site to the final impact point.\\n The SLV-3 launch schedule was dependent on the arrival\\n and integration of this equipment. On landing at the Madras\\n airport, the aircraft which Sivakami was traveling in\\n skidded and overshot the runway. Dense smoke engulfed\\n the aircraft. Everyone jumped out of the aircraft through\\n emergency exits, and desperately fought to save\\n themselves—all except Sivakami, who stayed in the aircraft\\n {ill he removed the transponder from his baggage. He was\\n among the last few persons, the others being mostly aircraft\\n crew, to emerge from the smoke and he was hugging the\\n transponder close to his chest.\\n \\n Another incident from those days that I recall clearly\\n relates to Prof, Dhawan\\'s visit to the SLV-3 assembly\\n building. Prof Dhawan, Madhavan Nair and 1 were\\n \\x0cdiscussing some finer aspects of the SLV-3 integration.\\n The vehicle was kept on the launcher in a horizontal\\n position. When we were moving around and examining the\\n readiness of the integrated hardware, 1 noticed the\\n presence of big water-ports for extinguishing fire in case of\\n an accident. For some reason, | felt uncomfortable at the\\n sight of the ports facing the SLV-3 on the launcher. |\\n suggested to Madhavan Nair that we could rotate the port\\n so that they were apart by a full 1800. This would prevent\\n the freak possibility of water gushing out and damaging the\\n rocket. To our surprise, within minutes of Madhavan Nair\\n getting the ports reversed, powerful water jets gushed out\\n of the ports. The Vehicle Safety Officer had ensured the\\n functioning of the fire-fighting system without realising thatit\\n could have wrecked the entire rocket. This was a lesson in\\n foresight. Or did we have divine protection?\\n \\n On 17 July 1980, 30 hours before the launch of the\\n second SLV-3, the newspapers were filled with all kinds of,\\n predictions. One of the newspapers reported, “The Project\\n Director is missing and could not be contacted.\" Many\\n reports preferred to trace the history of the first SLV3 fight,\\n and recalled how the third stage had failed to ignite\\n because of lack of fuel and the rocket had nosedived into\\n the ocean. Some fighighted SLV-3\\'s possible military\\n implications in terms of acquiring the capability for building\\n \\n me were a general prognosis of all that ailed our\\n county and related it to the SLV-3. I knew that the next\\n day\\'s launch was going to decide the future of the Indian\\n space programme. In fact, to put it simply, the eyes of the\\n whole nation were on us.\\n \\n h the early hours of the next day, 18 July 1980—at 0803\\n ts fo be precise, hdia\\'s first Satelite Launch Veticle,\\n SLV3 lied off fom SHAR. At 600 seconds before take,\\n off, | saw the computer displaying data about stage IV\\n giving the required velocity to the Rohini Satellite (carried\\n as payload) to enter its orbit. Within the next two minutes,\\n Rohini was set into motion in a low earth obit. I spoke, in\\n the midst of screeching decibels, the most important words\\n Thad ever uttered in my life, “Mission Director calling all\\n stations. Stand by for an important announcement. All\\n stages performed to mission requirements. The fourth\\n stage apogee motor has given the required velocity to put\\n Rohini Satellite into orbit’. There were happy cries,\\n everwhere. When | came out of the Block House, I was\\n lifted onto the shoulders of my jubilant colleagues. and\\n cartied ina procession,\\n \\n le nation was excited. India had made its entry\\n into the small group of nations which possessed satelite\\n launch capability. Newspapers carried news of the event in\\n their headlines. Radio and television stations aired special\\n programmes. Parliament greeted the achievement with the\\n thumping of desks. itwas both the culmination of a national\\n dream, and the beginning of a very important phase in our\\n nation\\'s Fistory. Prof, Satish Dhawan, Chairman ISRO,\\n threw his customary guardedness to the winds and\\n announced that it was now well within our ability to explore\\n space. Prime Minister dita Gandhi cabled her\\n congratulations. But the most important reactonwas that of\\n the Indian scientific community—everybody was proud of\\n this hundred per cent indigenous effort.\\n \\n I experienced mixed feelings. | was happy to achieve\\n the success which had been evading me for the past two\\n decades, but | was sad because the people who had\\n inspired me were no longer there to share my joy—my\\n father, my brother-in-law Jallaluddin, and Prof. Sarabhai\\n \\n The credit for the successful SLV-3 fight goes, first to\\n \\x0cthe giants of the Indian space programme, Prof. Sarabhai\\n in particular, who had preceded this effort next to the\\n hundreds of VSSC personne! who had through sheer wil-\\n power proved the mettle of our countymen and also, not\\n least, to Prof. Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash, who had led\\n the project.\\n \\n We had a late dinner that evening. Gradually, the din\\n and clatter of the celebrations calmed down. Iretired to my\\n bed with almost no energy left. Through the open window, |\\n could see the moon among the clouds. The sea breeze\\n seemed to reflect the buoyancy of the mood on Srinarikota\\n island that day,\\n \\n Within a month of the SLV-3 success, Ivisited the Nehru\\n Science Centre in Bombay for a day, in response to an\\n invitation to share my experiences with the SLV-3. There, |\\n received a telephone call from Prof. Dhawan in Delhi,\\n asking me to join him the next moming. We were to meet\\n the Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi. My hosts at the\\n Nehru Centre were kind enough to arrange my ticket to\\n Delhi, but had @ small problem. it had to do with my\\n clothes. Iwas dressed casually as is my wont and wearing\\n slippers—not, by any standards of etiquette, suitable attire\\n in which to meet the Prime Minister! When | told Prof.\\n Dhawan about this problem, he told me not to worry about\\n my dress. “You are beautifuly clothed in your success,\" he\\n quipped\\n \\n Prof. Dhawan and | amived at the Parliament House\\n Annexe the next moming. A meeting of the Parliamentary\\n Panel on Science & Technology chaired by the Prime\\n Minister was scheduled. There were about 30 Members of\\n the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha in the room, which was it\\n by a majestic chandelier. Prof. MGK Menon and Dr Nag\\n Chaudhuri were also present Shrimati Gandhi spoke to the\\n Members about the success of the SLV-3 and lauded our\\n achievement Prof. Dhawan thanked the gathering for the\\n encouragement given by them to space research in the\\n county and expressed the gratitude of the ISRO scientists,\\n and engineers. Suddenly, Isaw Shrimati Gandhi smiling at\\n me as she said, “Kalam! We would like to hear you speak.\"\\n Iwas surprised by the request as Prof. Dhawan had\\n already addressed the gathering\\n \\n Hesitartly, | rose and responded, “I am indeed\\n honoured to be in this great gathering of nation-builders. |\\n ‘only know how to build a racket system in our country, which\\n would inject satellite, built in our country, by imparting to it\\n a velocity of 25,000 km per hour” There was thunderous\\n applause. | thanked the members for giving us an\\n opportunity to work on a project like the SLV-3 and prove\\n the scientific strength of our country. The entire room was\\n irradiated with happiness.\\n \\n Now that Project SLV3 had been successfully\\n completed, VSSC had to reorganize its resources and\\n redefine its goals. | wanted to be relieved of the project\\n activites, and consequently Ved Prakash Sandlas from my\\n \\n Ss made the Project Director for the SLV-3\\n Continuation Project, which aimed at making operational\\n satellite launch vehicles of a similar class. With a view to\\n upgrade the SLV-3 by means of certain technological\\n innovations, the development of Augmented Satelite\\n Launch Vehicles (ASLVs) had been on the cards for some\\n time. The aim was to enhance the SLV-3 payload\\n capability from 40 kg to 150 kg. MSR Dev from my team\\n was appointed Project Director ASLV. Then, to reach the\\n sun-synchronous orbit (900 km), a PSLV was to be made.\\n The Geo Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) was also\\n \\x0cenvisaged, though as a distant dream. I took up the\\n position of Director, Aerospace Dynamics and Design\\n Group, so that | could configure the forthcoming launch\\n vehicles and technology development.\\n \\n The existing VSSC infrastructure was inadequate to\\n handle the size and weight of the future launch vehicle\\n systems and the implementation of all these projects was\\n going to require highly specialized facilites. New sites\\n were identified for the expanded activities of VSSC, at\\n Vatiyoorkawu and Valiamala. Dr Srinivasan drew up a\\n detailed plan of the facilities. Meanwhile, | carried out an\\n analysis of the application of SLV-3 and its variants with\\n Sivathanu Pillai, and compared the existing launch vehicles\\n of the world for missile applications. We established that\\n the SLV3 solid rocket systems would meet the national\\n requirements of payload delivery vehicles for short and\\n intermediate ranges (4000 km). We contended that the\\n development of one additional sold booster of 1.8 m\\n diameter with 36 tonnes of propellant along with SLV-3\\n subsystems would meet the ICBM requirement (above\\n 5000 km for a 1000 kg payload). This proposal was,\\n however, never considered. I nevertheless paved the way\\n for the formulation of the Re-entry Experiment (REX) which,\\n much later on, became Agni\\n \\n The next SLV-3 fight, SLV3-D1, took off on 31 May\\n 1981. I witnessed this fight from the visitors’ gallery. This\\n was the first time I witnessed a launch from outside the\\n Control Centre. The unpalatable tuth I had to face was that\\n by becoming the focus of media attention, I had aroused\\n envy among some of my senior colleagues, all of whom had\\n equally contibuted to the success of SLV-3. Was Ihurt at\\n the coldness of the new environment? Perhaps yes, but |\\n ‘was wiling to accept what I couldn\\'t change.\\n \\n Ihave never lived off the profits of others! minds. My life,\\n in keeping with my nature, has never been that of a ruthless,\\n achiever. The SLV-3 was made not by force and\\n manipulation, but through consistent collective effort Then\\n why this sense of bitterness? Was it peculiar to the VSSC.\\n top level or a universal reality? As a scientist, | was tained\\n to reason out reality. In science, reality is that which exists.\\n And because this bitterness was real, [had to reason it out.\\n But can these things be reasoned out?\\n \\n Were my postSLV experiences leading me into a\\n citical situation? Yes and no. Yes, because the glory of\\n SLV-3 had not gone to everyone who deserved it—but\\n hardly anything could have been done about that. No,\\n because a situation can be considered critical for a person\\n ‘only when realisation of the internal necessity becomes\\n impossible. And that certainly was not the case. Infact, the\\n concept of conflict is built upon this basic idea. h\\n retrospect, I can only say that | was fully aware of a great\\n need for actualization and renewal\\n \\n h January 1981, Iwas invited by Dr Bhagiratha Rao of\\n the High Altitude Laboratory (now the Defence Electronics\\n Applications Laboratory (DEAL)), Dehra Dun to give a\\n lecture on the SLV-3. The renowned nuclear scientist, Prof,\\n Raja Ramanna, whom Ihad always admired, and who was\\n then the Scientific Adviser to the Defence Minister,\\n presided over the gathering. He spoke on hdia\\'s efforts in\\n generating nuclear energy and the challenge in conducting\\n the first nuclear test for peaceful purposes. As | had been\\n so closely involved with SLV-3, it was natural that | was\\n soon in full spate about it. Later, Prof. Raja Ramanna\\n invited me for a private meeting over tea\\n \\n ‘The first thing that struck me when | met Prof Ramanna\\n was his genuine pleasure at meeting me. There was an\\n \\x0ceagemess in his tak, an immediate, sympathetic\\n ffiendliness, accompanied by quick, graceful movements.\\n The evening brought back memories of my first meeting\\n with Prof. Sarabhai—as if it was yesterday. The world of\\n Prof. Sarabhai was intemally simple and externally easy.\\n Each of us working with him was driven by a single-minded\\n need to create, and lived under conditions which made the\\n object of that need directly accessible. Sarabhai\\'s world\\n was tailor-made to our dreams. It had neither too much nor\\n ‘09 little of anything needed by any one of us. We could\\n divide it by our requirements without a remainder.\\n \\n My world, by now, had no simplicity left in it. ft had\\n become an internally complex and externally difficult world\\n My efforts in rocketry and in achieving the goal of making\\n indigenous rockets were impeded by external obstacles,\\n and complicated by intemal wavering. | was aware that it\\n required a special effort of the will to sustain my trajectory.\\n ‘The coordination of my present with my past had already\\n been jeopardised. The coordination of my present with my\\n future was uppermost in my mind when [went to have tea\\n vith Prof. Ramanna,\\n \\n He did not take long to come to the point The Devil\\n Missile programme had been shelved in spite of\\n tremendous achievements made by Narayanan and his\\n team at DRDL. The entire programme of military rockets\\n was reeling under a persistent apathy. The DRDO needed\\n somebody to take command of their missile programmes\\n which had been stuck at the drawing board and static test\\n bed stages for quite a while. Prof. Ramana asked me if |\\n would ike to join DRDL and shoulder the responsibility of\\n shaping their Guided Missile Development Programme\\n (GMDP). Prof. Ramanna\\'s proposal evoked a mixture of\\n emotions in me.\\n \\n When again would | have such an opportunity to\\n consolidate all our knowledge of rocketry and apply it?\\n \\n Ifelt honoured by the esteem in which Prof. Ramanna\\n held me. He had been the guiding spirit behind the\\n Pokharan nuclear test, and Iwas thrilled by the impact he\\n had helped create on the outside world about India\\'s\\n technical competence. I knew Iwould not be able to refuse\\n im. Prof. Ramanna advised me to talk to Prof. Dhawan on\\n this issue so that he could work out the modalities of my\\n transfer from ISRO to DRDL.\\n \\n Imet Prof, Dhawan on 14 January 1981. He gave me a\\n patient hearing, with his typical penchant for weighing\\n everything carefully to make sure he didn\\'t miss a point. A\\n markedly pleasant expression came to his face. He said, “I\\n am pleased with their appraisal of my man\\'s work\". He then\\n smiled. Ihave never met anyone with a smile quite like Prof.\\n Dhawan\\'s—a soft white cloud—you could picture it in any\\n shape you wanted to.\\n \\n I wondered how | should proceed. “Should | formally\\n apply for the post so that DRDL could send the\\n appointment order?\" | enquired of Prof. Dhawan. ‘No. Don\\'t\\n pressurise them. Let me tak to the top-level management\\n during my nest visit to New Delhi,” Prof. Dhawan said. “I\\n know you have always had one foot in DRDO, now your\\n whole centre of gravity seems to have shifted towards\\n them.\" Perhaps what Prof. Dhawan was teling me had an\\n element of truth in it, but my heart had always been at ISRO.\\n Was he really unaware of that?\\n \\n Republic Day, 1981 brought with it a pleasant surprise.\\n On the evening of 25 January, Mahadevan, Secretary to\\n Prof. UR Rao, rang up from Delhi to inform me about the\\n Home Ministry announcement about the conferment of the\\n \\x0cPadma Bhushan award on me. The next important call was\\n from Prof. Dhawan to congratulate me. | felt blissfully\\n elated as it was from my guru. Irejoiced with Prof. Dhawan\\n athis receiving the Padma Vibhushan and | congratulated\\n him wholeheartedly. Ithen rang up Dr Brahm Prakash and\\n thanked him. Dr Brahm Prakash chided me for the formality\\n and said, \"Ifeel as if my son has got the award.” was so\\n deeply touched by Dr Brahm Prakash\\'s affection that |\\n could no longer keep my emotions in check.\\n \\n Hiled my room with the music of Bismillah Khan\\'s\\n shehnai. The music took me to another time, another place.\\n Ivisited Rameswaram and hugged my mother. My father\\n ran his caring fingers through my hair My mentor,\\n Jallaluddin, announced the news to the crowd gathered on\\n Mosque Street. My sister, Zohara, prepared special sweets,\\n for me. Pakshi Lakshmana Sasty put a tlak on my\\n forehead. Fr. Solomon blessed me holding the holy cross. |\\n saw Prof, Sarabhai smiling with a sense of achievement—\\n the sapling which he had planted twenty years ago had\\n finally grown into a tree whose fruits were being\\n appreciated by the people of India\\n \\n Padma Bhushan evoked mixed reactions at VSSC.\\n While there were some who shared my happiness, there\\n were others who felt I was being unduly singled out for\\n recognition. Some of my close associates tumed ervious.\\n Why do some people fail to see the great values of life\\n because of sadly twisted thought processes? Happiness,\\n satisfaction, and success in life depend on making the right\\n choices, the winning choices. There are forces in life\\n ‘working for you and against you. One must distinguish the\\n beneficial forces from the malevolent ones and choose\\n correctly between them.\\n \\n Aninner voice told me that the time had come for a long\\n felt, but ignored, need for renewal. Let me clean my slate\\n and write new ‘sums’. Were the earier sums done\\n correctly? Evaluating one\\'s own progress in life is not an\\n easy task. Here the student has to set his own questions,\\n seek fis own answers and evaluate them to his own\\n satisfaction, Judgement aside, eighteen years at ISRO was\\n too long a stay to leave without pain. As for my afflicted\\n fiends, the lines by Lewis Carroll seemed very\\n appropriate:\\n \\n You may charge me with murder—\\n \\n Or vant of sense\\n \\n (We are all of us weak at times):\\n \\n But the slightest approach to a false pretence\\n Was never among my crimes!\\n \\n \\'s\\n \\x0c\\x0cPROPITIATION\\n \\n [1981 - 1991]\\n \\n Let craft, ambition, spite,\\n Be quenched in Reasons night, Till weakness turn to\\n might\\n Till what is dark be fight,\\n \\n Tilt what is wong be right!\\n Lewis Carroll\\n \\x0c\\x0cSeekers\\n \\n minor tussle over my services occurred at this time,\\n between ISRO, which was a little hesitant to relieve me, and\\n DRDO, which wanted to take me in. Many months went by,\\n \\n and\\n many lelers were exchanged between ISRO and\\n RDO; and meetings were held in the secretariats of the\\n Defence R&D establishment and the Department of Space\\n to precipitate a mutually convenient course of action.\\n Meanwhile, Prof. Ramanna retired from the office of the\\n Scientific Advisor to Defence Minister Dr VS\\n Arunachalam, til then Director of the Defence Metallurgical\\n Research Laboratory (DMRL) in Hyderabad, succeeded\\n Prof. Ramanna. Dr Arunachalam was known for his\\n confidence, and he cared itt for the intricacies and\\n nuances of the scientific bureaucracy. Meanwhile, 1\\n understand that the Defence Minister at that time, R\\n Venkataraman discussed the matter of my taking over the\\n missile laboratory with Prof. Dhawan. Prof. Dhawan also\\n seemed to be waiting for a decisive step at the highest\\n level in the Defence Ministry. Overcoming the niggling\\n doubts that had caused delays over the past year, the\\n decision to appoint me Director, DRDL was finaly taken in\\n February, 1982\\n f, Dhawan used to visit my room in the ISRO\\n headquarters and spend many hours in evolving space\\n launch vehicle projects. Itwas a great privilege to work with\\n such a great scientist Before | left ISRO, Prof. Dhawan\\n asked meto give a talk on the Space Programme Profile in\\n India by the year 2000. Aimost the entre ISRO\\n management and staff attended my tak, which was by way\\n ofa farewell meet\\n \\n Thad met Dr VS Arunachalam in 1976, when I visited\\n DMRL in connection with the aluminium alloy investment\\n casting for the SLV inertial guidance platform. Taking it as\\n a personal challenge, Dr Arunachalam had the investment\\n casting, the first of its kind in the county, made in the\\n incredibly shorttime of two months. His youthful energy and\\n enthusiasm never failed to amaze me. This young\\n metalurgist had within a short span of time lifted the\\n science of metal-making to the technology of metal-forming\\n and then to the art of alloy development. With a tall and\\n elegant figure, Dr Arunachalam was like an electrically\\n charged dynamo himself. I found him an unusually friendly\\n person with a forceful manner, as well as an excellent\\n working partner.\\n \\n Ihisited DRDLin April 1982 to acquaint myself with my\\n potential work site. The Director of DRDL then, SL Bansal,\\n took me around and introduced me to the senior scientists\\n in the laboratory. DRDL was working on five staff projects\\n and sixteen competence build-up projects. They were also\\n involved in several technology-orented activities with a\\n view fo gain lead time for the development of indigenous\\n mmissile systems in future. Iwas particuarly impressed by\\n their efforts on the twin 30-ton Liquid Propelant Rocket\\n \\n gine,\\n \\n Meanwhile, Anna University, Madras, conferred the\\n honorary degree of Doctor of Science on me. it had been\\n nearly twenty years since | had acquired my degree in\\n aeronautical engineering. Iwas happy that Anna University\\n had recognized my efforts in the field of rocketry, but what\\n pleased me most was the recognition of the value of our\\n work in academic circles. To my delight, the honorary\\n \\n  \\n \\x0cdoctorate degree was awarded at a convocation presided\\n over by Prof. Raja Ramana,\\n \\n Ijoined DRDL on 1 June, 1982. Very soon, I realized\\n that this laboratory was still haunted by the winding up of the\\n Devil missile project. Many excellent professionals had not\\n yet recovered from the disappointment People outside the\\n Scientific world may find it difficult to comprehend how a\\n scientist feels when the umbilical cord to his work is\\n suddenly snapped, for reasons totally alien to his\\n understanding and interests. The general mood and work\\n tempo at DRDL reminded me of Samuel Taylor\\n Coleridge\\'s poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\n \\n Day after day. day after day,\\n \\n We stuck, nor breath, nor motion;\\n As idfe as a painted ship\\n Upon a painted ocean.\\n \\n Ifound almost all my senior colleagues living with the\\n pain of dashed hopes. There was a widespread feeling that\\n the scientists of this laboratory had been cheated by the\\n senior officials in the Ministry of Defence. Itwas clear to me\\n that the burial of the Devil was essential for the rise of hope\\n and vision.\\n \\n When about a month later, Admiral OS Dawson, then\\n the Chief of Naval Staff, visited DRDL, I used it as an\\n ‘opportunity to make a point with my team. The Tactical\\n Core Vehicle (TCV) project had been hanging fire for quite\\n some time. was conceived as a single core vehicle with\\n certain common subsystems to meet the requirements of\\n the services fora quick reaction Surface-to-Air Missile, an\\n anti-radiation Air-to-Surface Missile which could be\\n launched from helicopters or fixed wing aircraft. |\\n emphasized the sea-skimming role of the core vehicle to\\n Admiral Dawson. [focussed not an its technical intricacies,\\n but on its battlefield capabilites; and | highlighted the\\n production plans. The message was loud and clear to my\\n new associates—do not make anything which you cannot\\n sell later and do not spend your life on making one thing\\n only. Missile development is a muit-dimensional business\\n —if you remain in any one dimension for a long time, you\\n vill get stuck\\n \\n My inital few months at DRDL were largely interactive. |\\n had read at St. Joseph\\'s that an electron may appear as a\\n particle or wave depending on how you look at it you ask\\n 2 particle question, it will give you a particle answer, if you\\n ask a wave question, it wil give you a wave answer. | not\\n only described and explained our goals, but also made\\n them an interplay between our work and ourselves. | still\\n recall quoting Ronald Fischer at one of the meetings, “The\\n sweetness we taste in a piece of sugar is neither a\\n property of the sugar nor a property of ourselves. We are\\n producing the experience of sweetness in the process of\\n interacting with the sugar.”\\n \\n Very good work on a Surface-to-Surface missile with a\\n vertical risetum straight line cimb-ballistic path had been\\n done by that time. | was astonished to see the\\n determination of the DRDL workforce, who, in spite of the\\n premature winding up of their earier projects, were eager\\n fo go ahead. arranged reviews for its various subsystems,\\n to arrive at precise specifications. To the horror of many\\n old-timers in DRDO, I started inviting people from the Indian\\n stitute of Science, Indian Institutes of Technology, Council\\n for Scientific and’ Industial Research, Tata Institute of\\n Fundamental Research, and many other educational\\n institutions where related experts could be found. [felt that\\n the stuffy work centres of DRDL needed a breath of fresh\\n \\x0cair. Once we opened the windows wide, the light of\\n scientific talent began to pour in. Once more, Coleridge\\'s\\n Ancient Mariner came to mind: *Swiflly, swiftly flew the\\n ship,\\\\ Riding gently the oncoming tide.”\\n \\n Sometime in the begining of 1983, Prof. Dhawan\\n Visited DRDL. | reminded him of his own advice to me\\n almost a decade ago: “You have to dream before your\\n dreams can come true. Some people stide towards\\n whatever it is that they want in life: others shuffle their feet\\n and never get started because they do not know what they\\n want—and do not know how to find it either” ERO was\\n lucky to have had Prof. Sarabhai and Prof. Dhawan at the\\n helm—teaders who elucidated their goals, made their\\n missions larger than their lives, and could then inspire their\\n entire workforce. DRDL had not been so lucky. This\\n excellent laboratory played a truncated role that did not\\n reflect its existing or potential capabilities or even fulfil the\\n expectations in South Block. I told Prof, Dhawan about the\\n highly professional, but sighty bewildered team I had. Prof.\\n Dhawan responded with Fis characteristic broad smile\\n which could be interpreted in any way one chose.\\n \\n h order to accelerate the pace of R&D activities at\\n DRDL, it was imperative that decisions on vital scientific,\\n technical and technological problems be taken quickly.\\n Throughout my career | had zealously pursued openness in\\n scientific matters. [had seen from very close quarters the\\n decay and disintegration that go with management through\\n closed-door consultations and secret. manipulations. |\\n always despised and resisted such efforts. So the first\\n major decision which we took was to create a forum of\\n senior scientists where important matters could be\\n discussed\\n \\n  \\n \\n Plate 9 The twin-engine indigenous hovercraft\\n prototype Nandi developed at ADE, Bangalore.

Thus, @ high\\n level body called the Missile Technology Committee was\\n formed within DRDL. The concept of management by\\n participation was evoked and earnest efforts were made to\\n involve middle-level scientists and engineers in the\\n management activities of the laboratory.\\n \\n Days of debate and weeks of thinking finally culminated\\n in the longterm ‘Guided Missile Development Programme!\\n Thad read somewhere, \"Know where you are going. The\\n great thing in the world is not knowing so much where we\\n stand, as in what direction we are moving.” What if we did\\n not have the technological might of the Western counties,\\n ‘we knew we had fo attain that might, and this determination\\n ‘was our driving force. To draw up a clear and well-defined\\n missile development programme for the production of\\n indigenous missiles, a committee was constituted under\\n my chairmanship. The members were ZP Marshall, then the\\n Chief of Bharat Dynamics Limited, Hyderabad, NR lyer, AK\\n Kapoor and KS Venkataraman, We drafted a paper for the\\n perusal of the Cabinet Committee for Political Affairs\\n (CCPA). The paper was given its final shape after\\n consuiting the representatives of the three Defence\\n Services. We estimated an expenditure of about Rs 390\\n crores, spread over a period of twelve years.\\n \\n Development programmes offen get stuck by the time\\n they reach the production stage, mainly because of lack of\\n funding. We wanted to get funds to develop and produce\\n two missiles—a lowlevel quick reaction Tactical Core\\n Vehicle and a Medium Range Surface-to-Surface Weapon\\n System. We planned to make a surface-to-air medium\\n range weapon system with mutti-target handing capability\\n during the second phase. DRDL had been known for its\\n pioneering work in the field of anti-tank missiles. We\\n proposed to develop a third generation anti-tank guided\\n missile having fire-and-forget capabilities. All my\\n colleagues were pleased with the proposal. They saw an\\n ‘opportunity to pursue afresh activities initiated long ago.\\n But was not entirely satisfied. longed to revive my buried\\n dream of a Re-entry Experiment Launch Vehicle (REX). |\\n persuaded my colleagues to take up a_ technology\\n development project to generate data for use in the design\\n ofheat shields. These shields were required for building up\\n capability to make longrange missiles in the future.\\n \\n I made a presentation in the South Block. The\\n presentation was presided over by the Defence Minister of\\n the time R Venkataraman, and attended by the three\\n Service Chiefs: General Krishna Rao, Air Chief Marshal\\n Dilbagh Singh and Admiral Dawson. The Cabinet\\n Secretary, Krishna Rao Sahib, Defence Secretary, SM\\n Ghosh and Secretary, Expenditure, R Ganapathy were\\n present. Everyone seemed to have all sorts of doubts—\\n about our capabilities, about the feasibility and availability\\n of required technological infrastructure, about the viability,\\n the schedule and cost Dr Arunachalam stood by me like a\\n rock throughout the entire question-answer session.\\n Members were skeptical and apprehensive of drift—which\\n they felt was common among scientists. Although some\\n questioned our ambitious proposal, everyone, even the\\n doubting Thomases, were very excited about the idea of\\n hidia having her own missile systems. In the end, we were\\n asked by Defence Minister Venkataraman to meet him in\\n the evening, about three hours later.\\n \\n We spent the intervening ime working on permutations\\n and combinations. If they sanctioned only Rs 100 crores,\\n how would we allocate it? Suppose they gave us Rs 200\\n \\x0ccrores, then what would we do? When we met the Defence\\n Minister in the evening, had a hunch we were going to get\\n some funds at any rate. But when he suggested that we\\n launch an integrated guided missile development\\n rogramme, instead of making missiles in phases, we\\n could not believe our ears.\\n \\n We were quite dumbfounded by the Defence Minister\\'s\\n suggestion, After a long pause, Dr Arunachalam replied,\\n “We beg for time to rethink and return, Sir!\" “You come\\n back tomorrow morning please,\" the Defence Minister\\n replied. I was reminiscent of Prof. Sarabhai\\'s zeal and\\n vision. That night, Dr Arunachalam and | laboured together\\n ‘on reworking our plan.\\n \\n We worked out some very important extensions and\\n improvements in our proposal, taking all the variables, such\\n as design, fabrication, system integration, qualification,\\n experimental fights, evaluation, updating, user trials,\\n producibility, quaity, reliability, and financial vability into\\n account. We then integrated them into a single function of\\n total accountability, in order to meet the needs of the\\n county\\'s armed forces with an indigenous endeavour. We\\n worked out the concepts of design, development,\\n production concurrency and proposed the participation of\\n ser and inspection agencies right from the drawing-board\\n stage. We also suggested a methodology to achieve state-\\n ofthe-art systems after all the years of developmental\\n activities. We wanted to deliver contemporary missiles to\\n ‘our Services and not some outdated inventory of weapons.\\n Iiwas a very exciting challenge thathad been thrown to us.\\n \\n By the time we finished our work, it was already\\n moming. Suddenly, at the breakfast table, | remembered\\n that | was to attend my niece Zameela\\'s wedding at\\n Rameswaram that evening. | thought it was already too late\\n to do anything. Even if Icould catch the Madras fight later in\\n the day, how would I reach Rameswaram from there? There\\n was no air link between Madras and Madurai from where |\\n could board the evening train to Rameswaram. A pang of\\n guilt dampened my spirits. Was it fair, Lasked myself, to\\n forget my family commitments and obligatons? Zameela\\n was more like a daughter to me. The thought of missing her\\n wedding because of professional preoccupations at Delhi\\n was very distressing. | finished breakfast and left for the\\n meeting.\\n \\n When we met Defence Minister Venkataraman and\\n showed him our revised proposal, he was visibly pleased\\n ‘The proposal of the missile development project had been\\n fumed ovemight into the blueprint of an integrated\\n programme with far-reaching consequences. R would have\\n wide-ranging technological spinoffs, and was exactly what\\n the Defence Minister had had in mind the previous evening\\n Notwithstanding the great respect | had for the Defence\\n Minister, was not really sure if he would clear our entre\\n proposal. But he did. Iwas absolutely delighted!\\n \\n The Defence Minister stood up, signaling that the\\n meeting was over. Turning to me he said, \"Since | brought\\n you here, | was expecting you to come up with something\\n like this. lam happy to see your work.\" Ina split second, the\\n mystery surrounding the clearance of my appointment as\\n Director DRDL in 1982 was cleared. So it was Defence\\n Minister Venkataraman who had brought me int Bowing in\\n thanks, | tumed towards the door when | heard Dr\\n Arunachalam telling the Minister about Zameela\\'s wedding\\n being scheduled for that evening at Rameswaram. It\\n amazed me that Dr Arunachalam should bring up this\\n matter before the Minister. Why would a person of his\\n \\x0cstature, siting in the altpowerful South Block, be\\n concerned about a wedding which was to take place on a\\n far-flung island in a small house on Mosque Steet?\\n \\n Ihave always had a high regard for Dr Arunachalam. He\\n has together with a command over language as he\\n displayed on this occasion, an uncanny presence of mind. |\\n was overwhelmed when the Defence Minister located an\\n Air Force helicopter doing sorties between Madras and\\n Madurai later in the day to take me to Madurai as soon as |\\n disembarked at Madras from the regular Indian Airines\\n fight, which was leaving Delhi in an hour\\'s time. Dr\\n Arunachalam told me, “You have eared this for your hard\\n ‘work of the last six months.”\\n \\n Fiying towards Madras, | scribbled on the back of my\\n boarding pass:\\n \\n Who never climbed the weary league —\\n \\n Can such a foot explore\\n The purple teritories\\n On Rameswaram’s shore?\\n \\n The Air Force helicopter landed close to the Indian\\n Airlines aircraft as soon as it arrived from Delhi. Within the\\n next few minutes I was on my way to Madurai. The Air\\n Force commandant there was kind enough to take me to\\n the railway station, where the tain to Rameswaram was\\n just about to rollout of the platfom. Iwas in Rameswaram\\n well in time for Zameela\\'s wedding. I blessed my brother\\'s\\n daughter with a father\\'s love.\\n \\n The Defence Minister put up our proposal before the\\n Cabinet and saw it through. His recommendations on our\\n proposal were accepted and an unprecedented amount of\\n Rs 388 crores was sanctioned for this purpose. Thus was\\n born hhdia\\'s prestigious Integrated Guided Missile\\n Development Programme, later abbrewated to BMDP.\\n \\n When | presented the government sanction letter before\\n the Missile Technology Committee at DRDL, they were\\n enthused with fire and action. The proposed projects were\\n christened in accordance with the spirit of India\\'s setf-\\n reliance. Thus the Surface-to-Surface weapon system\\n became Prithvi (‘the Earth’) and the Tactical Core Vehicle\\n was called Trishul (the tident of Lord Shiva). The Surface-\\n to-Air area defence system was named as Akash (‘sky\")\\n and the anti-tank missile project Nag (‘Cobra’). I gave the\\n name Agni (‘Fire’) to my long cherished dream of REX. Dr\\n Arunachalam came to DRDL and formally launched the\\n IGMDP on 27 July 1983. Itwas a great eventin which every\\n single employee of DRDL participated. Everybody who\\n was somebody in Indian Aerospace Research was invited\\n Allarge number of scientists from other laboratories and\\n ‘organizations, professors from academic institutions,\\n representatives of the armed forces, production centres,\\n and inspection authorities, who were our business parners\\n now, were present on this occasion. A closed-circuit TV\\n network had to be pressed into operation to ensure proper\\n communication between the participants for we had no\\n single place to accommodate all the invitees. This was the\\n second most significant day in my career, next only to 18\\n July 1980, when the SLV-3 had launched Rotini into the\\n earth\\'s orbit.\\n \\x0c\\x0cStewards\\n \\n he launch of the IGMDP was like a bright flash on the\\n dian scientific firmament. Missile Technology had been\\n considered the domain of a few selected nations in the\\n world. People\\n \\n were curious to see how, with what India had at that\\n point of time, we were going to achieve all that was\\n promised. The magnitude of the GMDP was. really\\n Unprecedented in the country and the schedules projected\\n were quite quixotic by the noms and standards prevailing\\n in the dian R&D establishments. | was fully aware that\\n obtaining sanction for the programme could at best be\\n seen as only ten per cent of the work done. To get it going\\n would be quite a different matter altogether. The more you\\n have, the more there is to maintain. Now that we had been\\n given all the necessary money and freedom to proceed, |\\n had fo take my team forward and fuflll the promises | had\\n made.\\n \\n What would be needed to realise this missile\\n programme, from the design fo the deployment stages?\\n Excelent manpower was available; money had been\\n sanctioned; and some infrastructure also existed. What\\n was lacking then? What else does a project need to\\n succeed apart from these three vital inputs? From my SLV-\\n 3 experience, | thought | knew the answer. The crux was\\n going to be out mastery over missile technology. | expected\\n nothing from abroad. Technology s a group activity and we\\n would need leaders who could not only put their heart and\\n soul into the missile programme, but also carry along with\\n them hundreds of other engineers and scientists. We knew\\n \\n be prepared to encounter numerous\\n contradictions and procedural absurdities that were\\n prevalent in the participating laboratories. We would have\\n to counteract the existing attitudes of our public sector\\n nits, which believed that their performance would never he\\n tested. The whole system—its people, procedures,\\n infrastructure—would have to learn to extend itself. We\\n decided to achieve something that was way beyond our\\n collective national capability and I, for one, had no illusions\\n about the fact that unless our teams worked onthe basis of\\n proportion or probability, nothing would he achieved\\n \\n ‘The most remarkable thing about DRDL was its large\\n pool of highly talented people, many of whom\\n unfortunately, ful of egotism and rebelliousness.\\n Unfortunately, they had not even accumulated enough\\n experience to make them confident about their own\\n judgement. On the whole, they would discuss matters very\\n enthusiastically, but would finally accept what a select few\\n said. They would unquestioningly believe in outside\\n specialists.\\n \\n A particularly interesting person I met in DRDL was AV\\n Ranga Rao. He was very articulate and had an impressive\\n personality. His usual garb consisted of a red necktie with\\n a checked coat and loose trousers. He would wear this in\\n the hot climate of Hyderabad, where even a longsleeved\\n shit and shoes are considered an avoidable\\n inconvenience. With fis thick white beard and a pipe\\n clamped between his teeth, there was a certain aura\\n around this extremely gifted, but rather egocentric\\n individual\\n \\n I consulted Ranga Rao on revamping the existing\\n management system to achieve an optimum utilization of\\n human resources. Ranga Rao had a series of meetings\\n \\x0cwith the scientsts sharing our vision of developing\\n indigenous missile technology and explaining the different\\n aspects of the IGMDP. After prolonged discussions, we\\n decided to reorganize the laboratory into a technology.\\n oriented structure. We needed to accommodate a matrix\\n type of structure for the execution of various activites\\n needed for the projects. In less than four months, four\\n hundred scientists began to work on the missile\\n programme.\\n \\n During this period, the most important task before me\\n was the selection of the Project Directors to lead individual\\n mmissile projects. We had a very large pool of talent. h fact,\\n itwas a market of plenty. The question was whom to pick—\\n @ go-getter, a planner, a maverick, a dictator or a team\\n man? Thad to get the right type of leader who could clearly\\n visualize the goal, and channelise the energies of his team\\n members who would be working at differentwork centres in\\n pursuit of their own individual goals.\\n \\n Twas a difficult game, some rules of which I had learnt\\n while working on ISRO\\'S high priority projects for two\\n decades. The wrong choice would jeopardise the entire\\n future of the programme. Ihad a detailed discussion with a\\n large number of prospective scientists and engineers. |\\n wanted these five Project Directors to train another twenty\\n five project directors and team leaders of tomorrow.\\n \\n Many of my senior colleagues—naming them would be\\n unfair, because it could be only my imagination—tied to\\n befiiend me during this period. I respected their concem for\\n a lonely man, but avoided any close contacts. Through\\n loyalty to a fiend one can be easily led into doing\\n something that is not in the best interests of the\\n organization.\\n \\n Perhaps the main motive behind my isolation was my\\n desire to escape from the demands of relationships, which\\n Iconsider very difficult in comparison to making rockets. All\\n I desired was to be tue to my way of life, to uphold the\\n science of rocketry in my country and to retire with a clean\\n conscience. Itook quite some time and did a lot of hard\\n thinking to decide who should lead the five projects. |\\n examined the working styles of many scientists before\\n making my decision. I think some of my observations may\\n interest you.\\n \\n A basic aspect of a person\\'s working style is how he\\n plans and organizes tasks. At one extreme is the cautious\\n planner, who carefully spells out each step before making\\n any move. With a sharp eye for what can possibly go\\n wrong, he tries to cover all contingencies. At the other end\\n is the fast mover, who weaves and dodges without a plan\\n hspired by an idea, the fast mover is always ready for\\n action.\\n \\n Another aspect of a person\\'s working style is control—\\n the energy and attention devoted to ensuring that things\\n happen in a certain way. At one extreme is the tight\\n controller, a strict administrator with frequent checkpoints.\\n Rules and policies are to he followed with religious fervour.\\n At the opposite end are those who move with freedom and\\n flexibility. They have little patience for bureaucracy. They\\n delegate easily and give their subordinates wide latitude\\n for movement I wanted leaders who tread the middle path,\\n those who could control without stifing dissent or being\\n rigid\\n \\n I wanted men who had the capability to grow with\\n possibilities, with the patience to explore all possible\\n alternatives, with the wisdom to apply old principles to new\\n situations; people with the skill to negotiate their way\\n forward. | wanted them to be accommodating, to be willing\\n \\x0cto share their power with others and work in teams,\\n delegating good jobs, assimilating fresh opinions,\\n respecting inteligent people, and listening to wise counsel\\n ‘They would have to be able to sort out things amicably, and\\n take responsibility for slip-ups. Above all, they should be\\n able to take failure in their stride and share in both success,\\n and failure.\\n \\n My search for someone to lead the Prithvi project ended\\n vith Col VJ Sundaram who belonged to the EME Corps of\\n the Indian Amy. With a postgraduate degree in\\n Aeronautical Engineering and expertise in mechanical\\n vibrations, Sundaram was head of the Structures Group at\\n DRDL. | found in him a readiness to experiment with new\\n ways of resolving conficting points of view. He was an\\n experimenter and innovator in team work. He had an\\n extraordinary capability for evaluating altemative ways of\\n operating. He would suggest moving forward into new\\n terrains that could lead to a solution which had not been\\n perceived earlier. Though a particular goal might be clear\\n fo a project leader, and he may be capable of giving\\n adequate directons for accomplishing it, there can be\\n resistance from subordinates if the goal makes no sense to\\n them. Therein lies the importance of a leader who provides\\n effective work directions. | thought the Project Director of\\n Prithsi would be the first fo make decisions with production\\n agencies and the armed forces, and Sundaram would be\\n the ideal choice to see that sound decisions were taken.\\n \\n For Trishul, Iwas looking for @ man who not only had a\\n sound knowedge of electronics and missile warfare, but\\n who could also communicate the complexities to his team\\n in order to promote understanding and to eam his team\\'s\\n support | found in Cmde SR Mohan, who sailed into\\n Defence R&D from the Indian Navy, a talent for detail and\\n an almost magical power of persuasion\\n \\n For Agni, my dream project, I needed somehody who\\n ‘would tolerate my occassional meddling in the running of this\\n project. In RN Aganwal | found the right person. He was an\\n alumnus of MIT with a brillant academic record and had\\n been managing the Aeronautical Test Facilites at DRDL\\n vith keen professional acumen\\n \\n Due to technological complexities, Akash and Nag\\n were then considered missiles of the future; their activites\\n were expected to peak about half a decade later\\n TTrereore,| selected the reatvelyyourg Prahlada ard NR\\n Wer for Akash and Nag. Two other young men,\\n Saraswat and AK Kapoor were nna deputies to\\n Sundaram and Mohan respectively.\\n \\n h those days, there was no forum in DRDL where\\n issues of general importance could be openly discussed\\n and decisions debated. Scientists, it must be remembered,\\n are basically emotional people. Once they stumble, it is,\\n difficuit for them to pull themselves together. Setbacks and\\n disappointments have always been and always will be an\\n inherent part of any career, even one in science. However, |\\n did not want any of my scientists to face disappointments\\n alone. | also wanted to ensure that none of them set their\\n goals when they were at a low ebb. To avoid such\\n eventualities a Science Council was created—a sort of\\n panchayat where the community would sit together and\\n take common decisions. Every three months, all scientists\\n —juniors and seniors, veterans and freshers— would sit\\n together and let off steam.\\n \\n The very first meeting of the Council was eventful. After\\n a spell of haifhearted enquiries and expressions of doubt,\\n ‘one senior scientist, MN Rao, shot a straight question: ‘On\\n \\x0cwhat basis did you select these five Pandavas (he meant\\n the Project Directors)?\" | was, in fact, expecting this\\n question. I wanted to tell him that | found all these five\\n Pandavas mamied to the Draupadi of positive thinking\\n stead, I told Rao to wait and see. I had chosen them to\\n take charge of a long-term programme where new storms\\n would arise everyday.\\n \\n Every tomorrow, | told Rao, will give opportunities to\\n these enthusiastic people—the Agarwals, Prahiadas, lyers,\\n and Saras-~wats— to gain a fresh perspective on their\\n goals and a strong hold on their commitments\\n \\n What makes a productive leader? In my opinion, a\\n productive leader must be very competent in staffing. He\\n should continually introduce new blood into the\\n ‘organization. He must be adept at dealing with problems\\n and new concepts. The problems encountered by an R&D\\n organization typically involve trade-offs among a wide\\n variety of known and unknown parameters. Skil in handing\\n these complex entities is important in achieving high\\n productivity. The leader must be capable of instilling\\n enthusiasm in his team. He should give appropriate credit\\n where itis due; praise publicly, but criticize privately.\\n \\n One of the most dificult questions came from a young\\n scientist: \"How are you going to stop these projects from\\n going the Devil way?\" | explained to him the philosophy\\n behind IGMDP—it begins with design and ends in\\n deployment. The participation of the production centres and\\n user agencies right from the design stage had been\\n ensured and there was no question of going back tll the\\n missile systems had been successfully deployed in the\\n battiefield\\n \\n While the process of forming teams and organizing\\n work was going on, | found that the space available at\\n DRDL was grossly inadequate to meet the enhanced\\n requirements of IGMDP. Some of the facilities would have\\n to be located at a nearby site. The missile integration and\\n checkout facility built during the Devil phase consisted only\\n of a 120 sq. metre shed thickly populated with pigeons.\\n Where was the space and the facilty to integrate the five\\n missiles which would arrive here shortly? The\\n Ervironmental Test Facility and the Avionics Laboratory\\n were equally cramped and ill-equipped. Inisited the nearby\\n Inarat Kancha area. it used to be the test range for ant-\\n tank missiles developed by DRDL decades ago. The\\n terrain was baren—there were hardly any trees— and\\n dotted with large boulders typical of the Deccan plateau. |\\n felt as if there was some temendous energy trapped in\\n these stones. | decided to locate the integration and check-\\n out facilites needed for the missile projects here. For the\\n nextthree years, this became my mission.\\n \\n We drew up a proposal to establish a model high\\n technology research centre with very advanced technical\\n facilities like an inertial instrumentation laboratory, full-scale\\n environmental and electronic warfare (EMVEMC) test\\n facilities, a composites production centre, high enthalpy\\n facility, and a state-of-the-art missile integration and\\n checkout centre. By any standards, this was a gigantic\\n task. An altogether different brand of expertise, grit and\\n determination were required to realise this project. Goals,\\n and objectives had already been decided upon. Now they\\n had to be shared with a large number of people from\\n various agencies, through the problem-solving and\\n communication processes that the leader of the team must\\n build and maintain. Who would be the most suitable person\\n to do so? I saw almost al the required leadership qualities\\n in MV Suryakantha Rao. Then, as a large number of\\n \\x0cagencies would participate in the creation of Research\\n Centre Inarat (RCI, someone had to protect hierarchical\\n sensitivities. | selected Krishna Mohan, who was in his\\n mmidthirties, to complement Suryakantha Rao, who was in\\n his late fifties at that time. Krishna Mohan would encourage\\n involvement rather than relying on obedience and\\n monitoring pee atthe warplanes\\n \\n Acco established procedure, we\\n approached the ‘itary Engineering Senices (MES) for\\n the RCI construction work. They said it would take five\\n years to complete the task. The matter was discussed in\\n depth at the highest level in the Ministry of Defence and a\\n landmark decision to entrust the responsibility of building\\n defence structures to an outside construction company was\\n taken. We liaised with the Survey of India and the National\\n Remote Sensing Agency for the inspection of the contour\\n maps and for obtaining aerial photographs of the Imarat\\n Kancha to prepare a layout for the approach roads and the\\n location of the facilities. The Central Ground Water Board\\n identified twenty locations amid the rocks to tap water.\\n hifastructure to provide 40 MVA power and 5 million iitres\\n of water per day was planned.\\n \\n 1 was also at this time that Col SK Salwan, a\\n mechanical engineer with boundless energy, joined us. h\\n the final phase of construction, Sahwan discovered an\\n ancient place of worship among the boulders. It seemed to\\n me that this place was blessed\\n \\n Now that we had started working on the design of the\\n missile systems and development had already commenced\\n for their integration and checkout, the next logical step was\\n to look for a suitable site for the missile fight trials. With\\n SHAR also in Andhra Pradesh, the search for a suitable\\n site spread towards the eastern coastine and finally ended\\n at Balasore in Orissa. A site along the north-eastern coast\\n was identified for a National Test Range. Unfortunately the\\n entire project ran into rough weather because of the\\n political issues raised around the evacuation of people\\n living in that area. We decided therefore to create an\\n interim infrastructure adjacent to the Proof Experimental\\n Establishment (PXE) at Chandipur in Balasore distict of\\n Orissa. A funding of Rs 30 crores had been given to\\n construct the range, called the Interim Test Range (ITR). Dr\\n HS Rama Rao and his team did an excellentjob of working\\n ‘out innovative and cost-effective specifications for electro-\\n ‘optical tracking instruments, a tacking telescope system\\n and an instrumentation tacking radar. Lt Gen RS Deswal\\n and Maj Gen KN Singh took charge of creating the launch\\n pad and range infrastructure. There was a beautiful bird\\n sanctuary in Chandipur. | asked the engineers to design the\\n test range without disturbing it.\\n \\n Creating the RCI was perhaps the most satisfying\\n experience of my life. Developing this centre of excellence\\n of missile technology was akin to the joy of a potter shaping\\n artifacts of lasting beauty from the mundane clay.\\n \\n Defence Minister R. Venkataraman visited DRDL in\\n September 1983 to appraise himself of the activities of\\n IGMDP. He advised us to list all the resources we needed\\n to achieve our goals, overlooking nothing, and then include\\n in the list our own positive imagination and faith. “What you\\n imagine, is what wil transpire. What you believe is what you\\n will achieve,\" he said. Both Dr Arunachalam and I saw in\\n the horizon endless possiblities stretching out before\\n IGMDP; and our enthusiasm proved infectious. We were\\n excited and encouraged to see the best professionals in\\n the country gravitating towards IGMDP. Who would not\\n \\x0cwant to associate with a winner? The word had evidently\\n got around that the IMDP was a bom winner.\\n \\x0c\\x0cWorkers\\n \\n We were at a meeting laying down the targets for 1984,\\n when news came of Dr Brahm Prakash\\'s death on the\\n evening of 3 January at Bombay, It was a great emotional\\n loss for me, for | had had the privilege of working under him\\n during the most challenging period of my career. His\\n compassion and humility were exemplary. His healing\\n fouch on the day of the failed SLV-E1 fight surfaced in my\\n memory serving to deepen my sorrow.\\n \\n F Prof, Sarabhai was the creator of VSSC, Dr Brahm\\n Prakash was the executor. He had nurtured the institution\\n when it most needed nourishment Dr Brahm Prakash\\n played a very important role in shaping my leadership skills,\\n h fact my association with him was a turning point in my\\n life. His humility mellowed me and helped me discard my\\n aggressive approach. His humility did not consist merely in\\n being modest about his talents or virtues, but in respecting\\n the dignity of all those who worked under him and in\\n recognizing the fact that no one is infallible, not even the\\n leader. He was an intellectual giant with a frail constitution;\\n he had a ctildlike innocence and | always considered hima\\n saint among scientists.\\n \\n During this period of renaissance at DRDL, an altitude\\n control system and an on-board computer developed by F\\n Banerjee, KV Ramana Sai and their team was almost\\n ready. The success of this effort was very vital for any\\n indigenous missile development programme. All the same,\\n we had to have a missile to test this important system.\\n \\n After many brainstorming sessions, we decided to\\n improvise a Devil missile to test the system. A Devil missile\\n was dis-assembled, many modifications made, extensive\\n subsystem testing was done and the missile checkout\\n system was reconfigured. After installing a make-shift\\n launcher, the modified and extended range Devil missile\\n was fired on 26 June 1984 to fight test the first indigenous\\n Strap-down Inertial Guidance system. The system met all\\n the requirements. This was the first and very significant\\n step in the history of Indian missile development, which had\\n so far been restricted to reverse engineering, towards\\n designing our own systems. A long-denied opportunity was\\n at last utiized by missile scientists at DRDL. The message\\n was loud and clear. We could do itt\\n \\n I did not take long for the message to reach Delhi\\n Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expressed her desire to\\n personally apprise herself of the progress of the IGMDP.\\n \\n entre organization was filed with an aura of\\n excitement. On 19 July 1984, Shrimati Gandhi visited\\n DRDL.\\n \\n Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was a person with a\\n tremendous sense of pride—in herself, in her work and in\\n her country. I deemed it an honour fo receive her at DRDL\\n as she had instilled some of her own pride into my\\n othenvise modest frame of mind. She was immensely\\n conscious that she was the leader of eight hundred million\\n people. Every step, every gesture, every movement of her\\n hands was optimised. The esteem in which she held our\\n work in the field of guided missiles boosted our morale\\n immensely.\\n \\n During the one hour that she spent at DRDL, she\\n covered wideranging aspects of the IGMDP, from fight\\n system plans to multiple development laboratories. In the\\n end, she addressed the 2000-strong DRDL community,\\n She asked for the schedules of the fight system that we\\n were working on. “When are you going to fight test Pith?\"\\n \\x0cShrimati Gandhi asked. | said, “June 1987.\" She\\n immediately responded, ‘Let me know what is needed to\\n accelerate the fight schedule.\" She wanted scientific and\\n technological results fast. “Your fast pace of work is the\\n hope of the entire nation,\" she said. She also told me that\\n the emphasis of the IGMDP should be not only on schedule\\n but also on the pursuance of excellence. “No matter what\\n you achieve, you should never be completely satisfied and\\n should always be searching for ways to prove yourself\" she\\n added. Within a month, she demonstrated her interest and\\n support hy sending the newly appointed Defence Minister,\\n SB Chavan, to review our projects. Shrimati Gandhi\\'s\\n follow-up approach was not only impressive, it was\\n effective too. Today, everyone associated with aerospace\\n research in our country knows that excellence is,\\n synonymous with the IEMDP.\\n \\n We had our home-grown, but effective, management\\n techniques. One such technique was concemed with follow.\\n up of project activites. I basically consisted of analysing\\n \\n possible solution, testing it with the work centres,\\n discussing it with the general body of associates and\\n implementing it after enlisting everybody\\'s support. A large\\n number of original ideas sprung up from the grass root level\\n ‘of participating work centres. If you were to ask me to.\\n indicate the single most important managerial tactic in this\\n successful programme, | would point to the pro-active\\n follow-up. Through follow-up on the work done at different\\n laboratories on design, planning, supporting services, and\\n by the inspection agencies and academic institutions, rapid\\n progress has been achieved in the most harmonious\\n manner. In fact, the work code in the Guided Missile\\n Programme Office was: if you need to write a letter to a\\n work centre, send a fax; if you need to send a telex or fax,\\n telephone; and if the need arises for telephonic\\n discussions, visit the place personally.\\n \\n The power of this approach came to light when Dr\\n Arunachalam conducted a comprehensive status revew of\\n IGMDP on 27 September 1984. Experts from DRDO\\n Laboratories, ISRO, academic institutions, and production\\n agencies gathered to critically review the progress made\\n and problems faced in the first year of implementation,\\n Major decisions like the creation of facilities at Imarat\\n Kancha and the establishment of a test facility were\\n crystallized during the review. The future infrastructure at the\\n Inarat Kancha was given the name of Research Centre\\n Inarat (RCI), retaining the original identity of the place.\\n \\n Iwas a pleasure to find an old acquaintance, TN\\n Seshan, on the review board. Between SLV-3 and now, we\\n had developed a mutual affection. However, this time as\\n the Defence Secretary, Seshan’s queries about the\\n schedules and viability of financial propositions presented\\n were much more pointed. Seshan is a person who enjoys\\n verbally bringing adversaries to their knees. Using his\\n sharp-edged humour, Seshan would make his opponents\\n look ridiculous. Although he is prone to be loud and can tum\\n argumentative on occasions, in the end he would always\\n ensure maximization of all available resources towards a\\n solution that was within implementation, At a personal level,\\n Seshan is a very kind-hearted and considerate person. My\\n team was particularly pleased to answer his questions\\n about the advanced technology employed in the IGMDP. |\\n still remember his uncanny curiosity about the indigenous\\n development of carbon-carbon composites. And to let you\\n into a small secret—Seshan is perhaps the only person in\\n the world who enjoys calling me by my full name which\\n \\x0ccontains 31 letlers and five words—Avul Pakir\\n Jainuabdeen Abdul Kalam,\\n \\n The missile programme had been pursued concurrently\\n and had partners in design, development and production\\n from 12 academic institutions and 30 laboratories from\\n DRDO, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research\\n (CSIR), ISRO and industry. h fact, more than 0 professors\\n and 100 research scholars worked on missile-related\\n problems in the laboratories of their respective institutes.\\n “The quality of work achieved through this partnership in that\\n ‘one year had given me tremendous confidence that any\\n development task could be undertaken within the country so\\n long as we have our focussed schedules. Four months\\n before this review, Ithink it was during April-June 1984, six\\n of us in the missile programme visited academic\\n campuses and enlisted promising young graduates. We\\n presented an outline of the missile programme before the\\n professors and the aspiring students, about 350 of them,\\n and requested them to participate. | informed the reviewers\\n that we were expecting around 300 young engineers to join\\n our laboratories.\\n \\n Roddam Narasimha, then Director of the National\\n Aeronautical Laboratory, used the occasion of this review\\n to put up a strong case for technology initiative. He cited\\n the experiences of the green revolution, which had\\n demonstrated beyond doubt that if the goals were clear,\\n there was enough talent available in the country to tackle\\n major technological challenges.\\n \\n n India carried out its first nuclear explosion for\\n peaceful purposes, we declared ourselves the sixth country\\n in the world to explode a nuclear device. When we\\n launched SLV-3 we were the fifth county to achieve\\n satellite launch capability. When were we going to be the\\n \\n ty in the world to achieve a\\n technological feat?\\n \\n listened carefully to the review members as they aired\\n their opinions and doubts, and Ileamed from their collective\\n wisdom. It was indeed a great education for me. Ironically,\\n all through school, we were taught to read, write and speak,\\n but never to listen, and the situation remains much the\\n same today. Traditionally, Indian scientists have been very\\n good speakers, but have inadequately developed listening\\n skills. We made a resolution to be attentive listeners. Are\\n engineering structures not built on the foundation of\\n functional utility? Does technical know-how not form its\\n bricks? And, are these bricks not put together with the\\n mortar of constructive criticism? The foundation had been\\n laid, the bricks baked, and now the mortar to cement our\\n act together was being mixed.\\n \\n ‘were working on the action plan that had emerged\\n from the earlier month\\'s review, when the news of Shrimati\\n Gandhi\\'s assassination broke. This was followed by the\\n news of widespread violence and riots. A curfew had been\\n imposed in Hyderabad city. We rolled up the PERT charts\\n and a city map was spread out over the table to organize\\n transport and safe passage for all employees. In less than\\n an hour, the laboratory wore a deserted look. | was left\\n siting alone in my office. The circumstances of Shrimati\\n Gandhi\\'s death were very ominous. The memories of her\\n Visit barely three months ago further deepened my pain.\\n Why should great people meet with such horrific ends? |\\n recollected my father teling someone in a similar context:\\n “Good and bad people live together under the sun as the\\n black thread and the white are woven together in a cloth,\\n When either one of the black or white thread breaks, the\\n \\x0cweaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine\\n the loom also.\" When Idrove out of the laboratory there was\\n not a single soul on the road. I kept thinking about the loom\\n ofthe broken thread.\\n \\n Shrimati Gandhi\\'s death was a tremendous loss to the\\n scientific community. She had given impetus to scientific\\n research in the country. But India is a very resilient nation. tt\\n gradually absorbed the shock of Shrimat Gandhi\\'s\\n assassination, although at the cost of thousands of lives,\\n and a colossal loss of property. Her son, Rajiv Gandhi, took\\n ‘over as the new Prime Minister of India. He went to the\\n polls and obtained a mandate from the people to carry\\n forward the policies of Mrs. Gandhi, the tegrated Guided\\n Missile Development Programme being a part of them.\\n \\n summer of 1985, all the groundwork had been\\n completed for building the Missile Technology Research\\n Centre at Imarat Kancha. Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi laid\\n the foundation stone of the Research Centre inarat (RCI)\\n ‘on 3 August 1985. He appeared very pleased with the\\n progress made. There was a childlike curiosity in him\\n which was very engaging. The grit and determination\\n displayed by his mother when she visited us a year ago\\n was also present in him, although with a small difference.\\n Madam Gandhi was a taskmaster, whereas Prime Minister\\n Rajiv Gandhi used his charisma to achieve his ends. He\\n told the DRDL family that he realised the hardships faced\\n by Indian scientists and expressed his gratitude towards,\\n those who prefered to stay back and work in their\\n motherland rather than go abroad for comfortable careers,\\n He said that nobody could concentrate on work of this type:\\n unless he was free from the tivialities of daily life, and\\n assured us that whatever necessary would be done to\\n make scientists’ ives more comfortable.\\n \\n Within a week of his visit | left for the USA with Dr\\n Arunachalam on an invitation from the United States Air\\n Force. Roddam Narasimha of National Aeronautical\\n Laboratory and KK Ganapathy of HAL accompanied us.\\n Alter finishing our work at the Pentagon in Washington, we\\n landed in San Francisco on our way to Los Angeles to visit\\n Northrop Corporation. | utilized this opportunity to visit the\\n Crystal Cathedral built by my favourite author, Robert\\n Schuler. lwas amazed by the sheer beauty of this all-glass,\\n fourpointed, star-shaped structure that is more than 400\\n feet from one point to another. The glass roof which is 100\\n feet longer than a football field seemed to float in space.\\n This Cathedral has been built at the cost of several milion\\n dollars through donations organized by Schuller. \"God can\\n do tremendous things through the person who doesn\\'t care\\n about who gets the credit. The ego involvement must go,\"\\n writes Schuller. “Before God trusts you with success, you\\n have fo prove yourself humble enough to handle the big\\n prize.\" I prayed to God in Schuller\\'s church to help me build\\n a Research Centre at the Imarat Kancha—that would be my\\n Crystal Cathedral\\n \\x0c\\x0cTriumphant\\n \\n ‘The young engineers, 280 to be precise, changed the\\n dynamics of DRDL. was a valuable experience for all of\\n us. We were now in a position to develop, through these\\n young teams, a re-entry technology and structure, a\\n mrillimetric wave radar, a phased array radar, rocket\\n systems and other such equipment. When we first assigned\\n these tasks to the young scientists, they did not fully grasp\\n the importance of their work. Once they did, they felt uneasy\\n under the burden of the tremendous faith placed in them. |\\n still remember one young man telling me, “There is no bi\\n shot in our team, how will we be able to break through?\" |\\n told him, \"A big shot is a litle shot who keeps on shooting,\\n so keep trying.” twas astonishing to see how in the young\\n scientific environment, negative attitudes changed to\\n positive and things that were previously thought impractical\\n began happening. Many older scientists were rejuvenated\\n simply by being part of a young team\\n \\n thas been my personal experience that the true flavour,\\n the real fun, the continuous excitement of work lie in the\\n process of doing it rather than in having it over and done\\n vith. To retum to the four basic factors that lam convinced\\n are involved in successful outcomes: goal-setting, positive\\n thinking, visualizing, and believing\\n \\n By now, we had gone through an elaborate exercise of\\n goal-setting and enthused the young scientists about these\\n goals. At the review meetings, | would insist that the\\n youngest scientists present their team\\'s work. That would\\n help them in visualizing the whole system. Gradually, an\\n atmosphere of confidence grew. Young scientists started\\n questioning senior colleagues on solid technical issues.\\n Nothing daunted them, because they feared nothing. Fthere\\n were doubts, they rose above them. They soon became\\n persons of power. A person with belief never grovels\\n before anyone, whining and whimpering that it\\'s all too\\n much, that he lacks support, that he is being treated\\n unfaidy. Instead, such a person tackles problems head on\\n and then affirms, ‘As a child of God, | am greater than\\n anything that can happen to me\\'. tried to keep the work\\n environment lively with a good blend of the experience of\\n the older scientists mixed with the skills of their younger\\n colleagues. This positive dependence between youth and\\n experience had created a very productive work culture at\\n DRDL.\\n \\n The first launch of the Missile Programme was\\n conducted on 16 September 1985, when Trishul took off\\n from the test range at Sriharikota (SHAR). ttwas a ballistic\\n flight meant for testing the inflight performance of the solid\\n propellant rocket motor. Two C-Band radars and Kalidieo-\\n theodolite (KTLs) were used to tack the missile from the\\n ground. The test was successful. The launcher, rocket\\n motor and telemetry systems functioned as planned. The\\n aerodynamic drag however was higher than the estimates\\n predicted on the basis of wind tunnel testing. In tems of\\n technology breakthrough or experience enrichment, this\\n test was of litle value but the real achievement of this test\\n was to remind my DRDL friends that they could fly missiles,\\n without being driven by the brute demands of compliance\\n or reverse engineering. In a swift stroke, the psyche of the\\n DRDL scientists experienced a mutt-dimensional\\n expansion.\\n \\n This was followed by the successful test fight of the\\n Pilotless Target Aircraft (PTA). Our engineers had\\n developed the rocket motor for the PTA designed by the\\n \\x0cBangalore-based Aeronautical Development\\n Establishment (ADE). The motor had been type- approved\\n by DTD&P (Air), This was a small but significant step\\n towards developing missile hardware that is not only\\n functional but also acceptable to the user agencies. A\\n private sector firm was engaged to produce a reliable,\\n airworthy, high thrust-to-weight ratio rocket motor with\\n technology input from DRDL. We were slowly graduating\\n from single laboratory projects to mult-laboratory\\n programmes to laboratoryindustry exercises. The\\n development of PTA symbolized a great confluence of four\\n different organizations. | felt as if | was standing at a\\n meeting point and looking at the roads coming from ADE,\\n DTD&P (Air) and ISRO. The fourth road was the DRDL, a\\n highway to national selfreliance in missile technology.\\n \\n Taking our partnership with the academic institutions of\\n the county a step further, Joint Advanced Technology\\n Programmes were started at the Indian Institute of Science\\n (llSc), and Jadavpur University. Ihave always had a deep\\n regard for academic institutions and reverence for excellent\\n academicians. | value the inputs that academicians can\\n make to development. Formal requests had been placed\\n with these institutions and arrangements arrived at under\\n which expertise from their faculties would be extended to\\n DRDL in pursuance of its projects\\n \\n Let me highlight 2 few contibutions of academic\\n institutions to the various missile systems. Prithvi had been\\n designed as an inertally guided missile. To reach the\\n target accurately, the trajectory parameters have to be\\n loaded into its brain—an on-board computer. A team of\\n young engineering graduates at Jadavpur University under\\n the guidance of Prof. Ghoshal developed the required\\n robust guidance algorithm. At the lSc, postgraduate\\n students under the leadership of Prof IG Sharma\\n developed air defence software for mult-target acquisition\\n by Akash. The re- entry vehicle system design methodology\\n for Agni was developed bya young team at IT Madras and\\n DRDO scientists. Osmania Universitys Navigational\\n Electronics Research and Training Unit had developed\\n stateof-the-art signal processing algorithms for Nag. Ihave\\n only given a few examples of collaborative endeavour. hh\\n fact it would have been very difficut to achieve our\\n advanced technological goals without the active\\n partnership of our academic institutions.\\n \\n Let us consider the example of the Agni payoad\\n breakthrough. Agni is a two-stage rocket system and\\n employs re-entry technology developed in the country for\\n the first time. it is boosted by a firststage solid rocket\\n motor derived from SLV-3 and further accelerated at the\\n second stage with the liquid rocket engines of Prithi. For\\n the Agni, the payload gets delivered at hypersonic speeds,\\n which calls for the design and development of a re-entry\\n vehicle structure. The payload with guidance electronics is\\n housed in the re-entry vehicle structure, which is meant to\\n protect the payload by keeping the inside temperature\\n within the limit of 400, when the outside skin temperature\\n is greater than 25000C. An inertial guidance system with\\n an on-board computer guides the payload to the required\\n target For any re-entry missile system, three-dimensional\\n preforms are core material for making the carbon-carbon\\n nose tip that will remain strong even at such high\\n temperatures. Four laboratories of DRDO and the CSIR\\n achieved this in a short span of 18 months— something\\n oter countries could do only after a decade of research\\n and development!\\n \\n ‘Another challenge involved in the Agni payload design\\n \\x0cwas related to the tremendous speed with which it would\\n reenter the atmosphere. In fact, Agni would re-enter the\\n atmosphere at twelve times the speed of sound (12 Mach,\\n a8 we call itin science). At this tremendous speed, we had\\n no experience of how to keep the vehicle under control. To\\n carry out a test, we had no wind tunnel to generate that kind\\n of speed. Ifwe sought American help, we would have been\\n seen as aspiring to something they considered their\\n exclusive privilege. Even if they consented to co-operate,\\n they would be certain to quote a price for their wind tunnel\\n greater than our entire project budget. Now, the question\\n ‘was how to beat the system. Prof. SM Deshpande of the\\n ISc found four young, bright scientists working in the field of\\n fuid dynamics and, within six months, developed the\\n software for Computational Fluid Dynamics for Hypersonic\\n Regimes, whichis one of its kind in the world\\n \\n ‘Another achievement was the development of a missile\\n trajectory simulation software, ANUKALPANA by Prof. IG\\n Sharma of [Sc to evaluate muititarget acquisiton\\n capabilities of an Akash-type weapon system. No country\\n would have given us this kind of software, but we\\n developed itindigenously.\\n \\n h yet another example of creating a synergy of scientific\\n talent, Prof. Bharati Bhatt of IT Delhi, working with the Solid\\n Physics Laboratory (SPL) and Central Electonics Limited\\n (CEL), broke the monopoly of the western counties by\\n developing ferrite phase shifters for use in the muli-\\n function, multitasking 3D Phased Army Radar for\\n surveillence, tracking and guidance of Akash. Prof. Saraf of\\n TT Kharagpur, working with BK Mukho-padhyay, my\\n colleague at RCI, made a millimetric wave (MMW) antenna\\n for the Nag Seeker Head in two years, a record even by\\n international standards. The Central Electrical and\\n Electronics Research hstitute (CER), Pilani developed\\n an Impatt Diode in consortium with the SPL and RCI to\\n ‘overcome technological foreign dependence in creating\\n these components, which are the heart of any MMW\\n device\\n \\n ‘As work on the project spread horizontally, performance\\n appraisal became more and more difficult. DRDO has\\n assessmentiinked policy. Leading nearly 500 scientists, |\\n had to finalize their performance appraisals in the form of,\\n Annual Confidential Reports (ACRs). These reports would\\n be forwarded to an assessment board comprised of\\n outside specialists for recommendations. Many people\\n viewed this part of my job unchatitably. Missing a\\n promotion was conveniently translated as a dislike | had\\n towards them. Promotions of other colleagues were seen\\n as subjective favours granted by me. Entrusted with the\\n task of performance evaluation, | had to be a fair judge.\\n \\n To tuly understand a judge, you must understand the\\n riddle of the scales; one side heaped high with hope, the\\n ‘other side holding apprehension. When the scales dip,\\n bright optimism turns into silent panic.\\n \\n en a person looks at himself, he is likely to misjudge\\n what he finds. He sees only his intentions. Most people\\n have good intentions and hence conclude that whatever\\n they are doing is good. I is difficut for an individual to\\n objectively judge his actons, which may be, and often are,\\n contradictory to his good intentions. Most people come to\\n ‘work with the intention of doing it. Many of them do their\\n ‘work ina manner they find convenient and leave for home\\n in the evening with a sense of satisfaction. They do not\\n evaluate their performance, only their intentions. is\\n assumed that because an individual has worked with the\\n \\x0cintenton of finishing his work in time, if delays occurred,\\n they were due to reasons beyond his control. He had no\\n intention of causing the delay. But if his action or inaction\\n caused that delay, was itnot intentional?\\n \\n ooking back’ on my days as a young scientist, | am\\n aware that one of the most constant and powerful uyes |\\n experienced was my desire to be more than what Iwas at\\n that moment. I desired to feel more, learn more, express\\n more. I desired to grow, improve, purify, expand. I never\\n used any outside influence to advance my career. All |had\\n was the inner urge to seek more within myself. The key to\\n my motivation has always been to look at how far I had stil\\n to go rather than how far Ihad come. After all, what is life\\n but a mixture of unsolved problems, ambiguous victories,\\n and amorphous defeats?\\n \\n ‘The trouble is that we often merely analyse life instead\\n \\n of dealing with it. People dissect their failures for causes\\n and effects, but seldom deal with them and gain experience\\n fo master them and thereby avoid their recurrence. This is\\n my belief: that through difficulties and problems God gives,\\n us the opportunity to grow. So when your hopes and\\n dreams and goals are dashed, search among the\\n wreckage, you may find a golden opportunity hidden in the\\n nins,\\n To motivate people to enhance their performance and\\n deal with depression is ahvays a challenge for a leader. |\\n have observed an analogy between a force field\\n equilibrium and resistance to change in organizations. Let\\n us imagine change to be a coiled spring in a field of\\n ‘opposing forces, such that some forces support change\\n and others resist it. By increasing the supportive forces\\n such as supervisory pressure, prospects of career growth\\n and monetary benefits or decreasing the resisting forces,\\n such as group norms, social rewards, and work avoidance,\\n the situation can be directed towards the desired resul—\\n but for a short time only, and that too only to a certain\\n extent. After a while the resisting forces push back with\\n greater force as they are compressed even more tightly.\\n Therefore, a better approach would be to decrease the\\n resisting force in such a manner that there is no\\n concomitant increase in the supporting forves. In this way,\\n less energy will be needed to bring about and maintain\\n change.\\n \\n The result of the forces I mentioned above, is motive. It\\n is a force which is internal to the individual and forms the\\n basis of his behaviour in the work environment h my\\n experience, most people possess a strong inner drive for\\n growth, competence, and self actualization. The problem,\\n however, has been the lack of a work environment that\\n stimulates and pemnits them to give full expression to this,\\n drive. Leaders can create a high productivity level by\\n providing the appropriate organizational structure and job\\n design, and by acknowledging and appreciating hard work.\\n \\n I first attempted to build up such a supportive\\n environment in 1983, while launching IEMDP: The projects\\n were in the design phase at that time. The re-organization\\n resulted in at least forty per centto fifty per cent increase in\\n the level of activity. Now that the muliple projects were\\n entering into the development and flighttesting stage, the\\n major and minor milestones reached gave the programme\\n Visibility and continuous commitment. With the absorption\\n of 2 young team of scientists, the average age had been\\n brought down from 42 to 33 years. [felt it was time for a\\n second re-organization. But how should | go about it? Itook\\n stock of the motivational inventory available at that ime—\\n let me explain to you what | mean by this term. The\\n \\x0cmotivational inventory of a leader is made up of three types\\n of understanding: an understanding of the needs that\\n people expect to satisfy in their jobs, an understanding of\\n the effect that job design has on motivation, and an\\n understanding of the power of positive reinforcement in\\n influencing people\\'s behaviour.\\n \\n The 1983 re-organization was done with the objective of\\n renewal: it was indeed a very complex exercise handled\\n defly by AV Ranga Rao and Col R Swaminathan. We\\n created a team of newlyjoined young scientists with just\\n ‘one experienced person and gave them the challenge of\\n building the strap-down inertial guidance system, an on\\n board computer and a ram rocket in propulsion system,\\n ‘These exercises were being attempted for the first time in\\n the country, and the technology involved was comparable\\n with world-class systems. The guidance technology is\\n centred around the gyro and accelerometer package, and\\n electronics, to process the sensor output The on-board\\n computer carries the mission computations and flight\\n sequencing. A ram rocket system breathes air to sustain its\\n high velocity for long durations after it is put through a\\n booster rocket. The young teams not only designed these\\n systems but also developed them into operational\\n equipment Later Pritt’ and then Agni used similar\\n guidance systems, with excellent results. The effort of these\\n young teams made the country selfreliant in the area of\\n protected technologies. twas a good demonstration of the\\n ‘renewal factor’. Our intellectual capacity was renewed\\n through contact with enthusiastic young minds and had\\n achieved these outstanding results\\n \\n Now, besides the renewal of manpower, emphasis had\\n to be laid on augmenting the strength of project groups.\\n Often people seek to satisfy their social, egoistic, and setf-\\n actualization needs at their workplaces. A good leader\\n must identify two different sets of envronmental features.\\n One, which satisfies a person\\'s needs and the other, which\\n creates dissatisfaction with his work. We have already\\n ‘observed that people look for those characteristics in their\\n ‘work that relate to the values and goals which they consider\\n important as giving meaning bier Ives Fa job meets the\\n employeesineed for achievement, recognition,\\n responsibility, growth and advancement they will work hard\\n to achieve goals,\\n \\n Once the work is satisfying, a person then looks at the\\n environment and circumstances in the workplace. He\\n observes the poiicies of the administration, qualities of his\\n leader, security, status and working conditions. Then, he\\n correlates these factors to the inter-personal relations he\\n has with his peers and examines his personal life in the\\n light of these factors. I is the agglomerate of all these\\n aspects that decides the degree and quality of a person\\'s,\\n effort and performane:\\n \\n The matix organization evolved in 1983 proved\\n excellent in meeting all these requirements. So, while\\n retaining this structure of the laboratory, we undertook a\\n task-design exercise. The scientists working in technology\\n directorates were made system managers to interact\\n exclusively with one project. An extemal fabrication wing\\n was formed under PK Biswas, a developmental fabrication\\n technologist of long standing, to deal with the public sector\\n undertakings (PSUs) and private sector firms associated\\n vith the development of the missile hardware. This reduced\\n pressure on the in-house fabrication facilites and enabled\\n them to concentrate on jobs which could not be undertaken\\n ‘outside, which in fact occupied all the three shifts\\n \\x0cfork on Prith was nearing completion when we\\n entered 1988. For the first ime in the country, clustered\\n Liquid Propellant (LP) rocket engines with programmable\\n total impulse were going to be used in a missile system to.\\n attain flexibility in payload range combination. Now,\\n besides the scope and quality of the policy decisions\\n Sundaram and | were providing to the Prith team, the\\n project\\'s success depended on creative ideas being\\n converted into workable products and the quality and\\n thoroughness of the team members’ contribution. Saraswat\\n \\n Gyaneshwar and P_ Venugopalan did a\\n commendable job in this regard. They instiled in their team\\n \\n projectit was a national achievement. Under their\\n collective leadership, a large number of engineers and\\n technicians understood and committed themselves to the\\n team goals, as well as the specific goals which each one of\\n them was committed to accomplish personally. Their entire\\n team worked under a setfevident sort of direction. Working\\n together with the Ordnance Factory, Kirkee, they also\\n completely eliminated the import content in the propellant\\n for these engines.\\n \\n Leaving the vehicle development in the safe and\\n efficient hands of Sundaram and Saraswat, | started\\n looking at the mission\\'s wiherable areas. Meticulous\\n planning had gone into the development of the launch\\n release mechanism (LRM) for the smooth liftoff of the\\n missile. The joint development of explosive bolts to hold the\\n LRM prior to the launch by DRDL and Explosive Research\\n and Development Laboratory (ERDL) was an excellent\\n example of multi- work centre coordination\\n \\n While flying, drifing into spells of contemplation and\\n looking down at the landscape below has ahvays been my\\n favourite preoccupation. itis so beautiful, so harmonious,\\n So peaceful from a distance that I wonder where all those\\n boundaries are which separate district from district, state\\n from state, and country from county. Maybe such a sense\\n of distance and detachment is required in dealing with all\\n the activities of our life.\\n \\n Since the Interim Test Range at Balasore was stil at\\n least a year away from completion, we had set up special\\n facilities at SHAR for the launch of Prithw.. These included a\\n launch pad, block house, contol consoles and mobile\\n telemety stations. | had a happy reunion with my old fiend\\n MR Kurup who was the Director, SHAR Centre by then\\n Working with Kurup on the Prithvi launch campaign gave\\n me great satisfaction. Kurup worked for Prithvi as a team\\n member, ignoring the boundary lines that divide DRDO and\\n ISRO, DRDL and SHAR. Kurup used to spend a lot of time\\n with us at the launch pad. He complemented us with his\\n experience in range testing and range safety and worked\\n with great enthusiasm in propellant filing, making the\\n maiden Prithvi launch campaign a memorable experience.\\n \\n Prithsi was launched at 11:23 hrs on 25 February 1988.\\n Iwas an epoch-making event in the history of rocketry in\\n the county. Prith was not merely a surface-to-surface\\n missile with a capability of delivering a 1000 kg\\n conventional warhead to a distance of 150 km with an\\n accuracy of 50 meter CEP; it was in fact the basic module\\n for all future guided missiles in the country. it already had\\n the provision for modification from a long-range surface to\\n an air missile system, and could also be deployed on a\\n ship.\\n \\n uracy of a missile is expressed in terms of its\\n Circular Error Probable (CEP. This measures the radius of\\n \\x0ca circle within which 50 per cent of the missiles fired will\\n impact. In other words, if a missile has a CEP of 1 km\\n (such as the Fagi Scud missiles fired in the Gulf War), this\\n means that half of them should impact within 1 km of their\\n target A missile with a conventional high-explosive\\n warhead and a CEP of 1 km would not normally be\\n expected to destroy or disable fixed military targets such as,\\n a Command and Control Facility or an Air Base. it would\\n however be effective against an undefined target such as a\\n ci\\n \\n The German V-2 missiles fired at London between\\n September 1944 and March 1945 had a conventional high-\\n explosive warhead and a very large CEP of some 17 km\\n Yet the 500 V-2s which hit London succeeded in causing\\n more than 21,000 casualties and destroying about 200,000\\n homes.\\n \\n When the West were crying themselves hoarse over the\\n NPT, we stressed upon building competence in core\\n guidance and control technologies to achieve a CEP as\\n precise as 50 m. With the success of the Prithvi tials, the\\n cold reality of a possible strategic stike even without a\\n nuclear warhead had silenced the critics to whispers about\\n a possible technology-conspiracy theory.\\n \\n The launch of Prithvi sent shock waves across the\\n unfiiendly neighbouring counties. The response of the\\n Westem bloc was initially one of shock and then of anger. A\\n sever-nation technology embargo was clamped, making it\\n impossible for hdia to buy anything even remotely\\n connected with the development of guided missiles. The\\n emergence of India as a self-reliant country in the field of\\n guided missiles upset all the developed nations of the\\n ‘world\\n \\x0c\\x0cTorchbearers\\n \\n hidian core competence in rockety has been firmly\\n established again, beyond any doubt. The robust civilian\\n space industy and viable missilebased defences has\\n brought India into the select club of nations that call\\n themselves superpowers. Always encouraged to follow\\n Buddha\\'s or Gandhi\\'s teachings, how and why did India\\n become a missile power is a question that needs to be\\n answered for future generations.\\n \\n Two centuries of subjugation, oppression and denial\\n have failed to kill the creativity and capability of the Indian\\n people. Within just a decade of gaining independence and\\n achieving sovereignty, Indian Space and Atomic Energy\\n Programmes were launched with a perfect orientation\\n towards peaceful applications. There were neither funds for\\n investing in missile development nor any established\\n requirement from the Armed Forces. The bitter\\n experiences of 1962 forced us to take the basic first steps,\\n towards missile development.\\n \\n Would a Pritt suffice? Would the indigenous\\n development of four or five missile systems make us\\n sufficienty strong? Or would having nuclear weapons make\\n us stronger? Missiles and atomic weapons are merely\\n parts of a greater whole. As I saw it, the development of\\n Prithi represented the self-reliance of our country in the\\n field of advanced technology. High technology is\\n \\n synonymous with huge amounts of money and massive\\n infrastructure. Neither of these was available, unfortunately,\\n in adequate measure. So what could we do? Perhaps the\\n Agni missile being developed as a technology\\n demonstrator project, pooling all the resources available in\\n the country, could provide an answer?\\n \\n Iwas very sure, even when we discussed REX in ISRO\\n \\n about a decade ago, that Indian scientists and\\n technologists working together had the capability to\\n achieve this technological breakthrough. India can most\\n cerlainy achieve state-ofthe-art technology through a\\n combined effort of the scientific laboratories and the\\n academic institutions. F one can liberate Indian industry\\n from the self-created image of being mere fabricating\\n factories, they can implement indigenously developed\\n technology and attain excellent results. To do this, we\\n adopted a threefold — strategy— —_multi-institutional\\n participation, the consorium approach, and the\\n empowering technology. These were the stones rubbed\\n together to create Agni\\n e Agni team was comprised of more than 500\\n scientists. Many organizations were networked to\\n undertake this huge effort of launching Agni. The Agni\\n mission had two basic orientations— work and workers,\\n Each member was dependent on the others in his team to\\n accomplish his target Contradiction and confusion are the\\n two things most likely to occur in such situations. Different\\n leaders accommodate concer for workers while getting\\n work done, in their own personal ways. Some shed all\\n concern for workers in order to getresults. They use people\\n merely as instruments to reach goals. Some give less\\n importance to the work, and make an effort to gain the\\n wamnth and approval of people working with them. Butwhat\\n this team achieved was the highest possible integration in\\n terms of both the quality of work and human relationships,\\n volvement, participation and commitment were the key\\n words to functioning. Each of the team members appeared\\n to be performing by choice. The launching of Agni was the\\n \\x0ccommon stake not only for our scientists, but for their\\n families too. VR Nagaraj was the leader of the electrical\\n integration team. Dedicated technologist that he is,\\n Nagaraj would forget basic requirements like food and\\n sleep while on the integration gig. His brotherinlaw\\n passed away while he was at ITR. His family kept this,\\n information from Nagaraj so that there would be no\\n interruption in his work towards the launching of Agri\\n \\n ‘The Agni launch had been scheduled for 20 April 1989.\\n This was going to be an unprecedented exercise. Unike\\n space launch vehicles, a missile launch involves wide-\\n ranging safety hazards. Two radars, three telemetry\\n stations, one telecommand station and four electro-optical\\n tracking instruments to monitor the missile trajectory had\\n been deployed. In addition, the telemetry station at Car\\n Nicobar (ISTRAC) and the SHAR radars were also\\n commissioned to track the vehicle. Dynamic surveillance\\n was employed to cover the electrical power that fows from\\n the missile batteries within the vehicle and to control\\n system pressures. Should any deviation be noticed either\\n in voltage or in pressure, the specially designed automatic\\n checkout system would signal ‘Hold’. The fight operations\\n would then be sequenced only if the defect was rectified\\n The countdown for the launch started at 7-36 hours. The\\n countdown from 77.5 minutes was to be computer\\n controlled\\n \\n Al activities preparatory to the launch went according to\\n schedule. We had decided to move the people living in\\n nearby villages to safely at the time of the launch. This\\n attracted media attention, and led to much controversy. By\\n the ime 20 April 1989 arrived, the whole nation was\\n watching us. Foreign pressure was exerted through\\n diplomatic channels to abort the fight trial, but the Indian\\n Government stood behind us like a rock and staved off any\\n distraction to our work. We were at T-14 seconds when the\\n computer signalled *Hold\", indicating that one of the\\n instruments was functioning erratically. This was.\\n immediately rectified. Meanwhile, the down-range station\\n asked for a “Hold”. In another few seconds, multiple Holds\\n were necessitated, resulting in imeversible internal power\\n consumption. We had to abort the launch, The missile had\\n to be opened up to replace the on-board power supplies. A\\n weeping Nagarej, by now informed about the tragedy in his\\n family, met me and promised that he would be back within\\n three days. The profiles of these courageous people will\\n never be written about in any history book, but it is such\\n silent people on whose hard work generations thrive and\\n nations progress. Sending Nagaraj off, | met my team\\n members who were in a state of shock and sorrow. |\\n shared my SLV-3 experience with them. ‘I lost my launch\\n vehicle in the sea but recovered successfully. Your missile\\n is in front of you. In fact you have lost nothing but a few\\n weeks of rework.\" This shook them out of their immobility\\n and the entire team went back to retrieve the subsystems\\n and cesharge them\\n \\n press was up in arms, and fielded various\\n \\n interpretations ‘of the postponement of the flight to suit the\\n fancies of their readership. Cartoonist Sudhir Dar sketched\\n a shopkeeper returning a product to the salesman saying\\n that like Agni it would not take off. Another cartoonist\\n showed one Agni scientist explaining that the launch was\\n postponed because the press button did not make contact.\\n The Hindustan Times showed @ leader consoling press\\n reporters, “There\\'s no need for any alam ... its a purely\\n peaceful, non-violent missile\"\\n \\n ‘After a detailed analysis conducted virtually around the\\n \\x0cclock for the next ten days, our scientists had the missile\\n ready for launch on 1 May 1989. But, again, during the\\n automatic computer checkout period at T10 seconds, a\\n Hold signal was indicated. A closer inspection showed that\\n ‘one of the control components, S1-TVC was not workit\\n according to the mission requirements. The launch had to\\n be postponed yet again. Now, such things are very\\n common in rocketry and quite often happen in other\\n countries too. But the expectant nation was in no mood to\\n appreciate our difficutties. The Hindu cared a cartoon by\\n Keshav showing a vilager counting some currency notes,\\n and commenting to another, “Yes, it\\'s the compensation for\\n moving away from my hut near the test site—a few more\\n postponements and | can build a house of my own...”\\n Another cartoonist. designated Agni as * IDBM—\\n htemittenty Delayed Balistic Missile.\" Amul\\'s cartoon\\n suggested that what Agni needed to do was use their butter\\n as fuel!\\n \\n Hook some time off, leaving my team at ITR to talk to\\n the DRDLRCI community. The entire DRDL-RCI community\\n assembled after working hours on & May 1989. |\\n addressed the gathering of more than 2,000 persons, “Very\\n rarely isa laboratory or an R&D establishment given an\\n ‘opportunity to be the firstin the country to develop a system\\n such as Agni. A great opportunity has been given to us.\\n Naturally major opportunities are accompanied by equally\\n major challenges. We should not give up and we should not\\n allow the problem to defeat us. The county doesn\\'t deserve\\n anything less than success from us. Let us aim for\\n success”. [had almost completed my address, when I found\\n myself teling my people, ‘I promise you, we will be back\\n after successfully launching Agni before the end of this\\n month.\"\\n \\n Detailed analysis of the component failure during the\\n second attempt led to the refurbishment of the control\\n system. This task was entrusted to a DRDO-SRO team\\n The team carried out the rectification of the first stage\\n control system at the Liquid Propellant System Complex\\n (LPSC) of SRO and completed the task in record tme with\\n tremendous concentration and willpower. It was nothing\\n short of amazing how hundreds of scientists and staff\\n worked continuously and completed the system readiness\\n with acceptance tests in just 10 days. The aircraft took off\\n from Trivandrum with the rectified control systems and\\n landed close to ITR on the eleventh day. But now it was the\\n tum of hostile weather conditions to impede us. A cyclone\\n threat was looming large. All the work centres were\\n connected through satelite communication and HF inks.\\n Meteorological data started flowing in at ten-minute\\n intervals.\\n \\n Finally, the launch was scheduled for 22 May 1989. The\\n previous night, Dr Arunachalam, Gen KN Singh and I were\\n walking together with the Defence Minister KC Pant, who\\n had come to ITR to witness the launch, I was a fulkmoon\\n right, it was high tide and the waves crashed and roared,\\n as if singing of His glory and power. Would we succeed\\n vith the Agni launch tomorrow? This question was foremost\\n in all our minds, but none of us was willing to break the spell\\n cast by the beautiful moonit night Breaking a long silence,\\n the Defence Minister finally asked me, “Kalam! what would\\n youlike me to doto celebrate the Agni success tomorrow?\"\\n Iwas a simple question, to which I could not think of an\\n answer immediately. What did hwant? What was itthat | did\\n not have? What could make me happier? And then [ound\\n the answer. ‘We need 100,000 saplings to plant at RCI\" |\\n \\x0csaid. His face litup with a friendly glow. “You are buying the\\n blessings of Mother Earth for Agni,\" Defence Minister KC\\n Pant quipped. “We will succeed tomorrow’, he predicted\\n \\n The next day Agni took off at 0710 hrs. twas a perfect\\n launch. The missile followed a textbook trajectory. All fight\\n parameters were met. it was ike waking up to a beautiful\\n moming from a nightmarish sleep. We had reached the\\n launch pad after five years of continuous work at multiple\\n ‘work centres. We had lived through the ordeal of a series of\\n snags in the last five weeks. We had survived pressure\\n from everywhere to stop the whole thing. But we did it at\\n last! Iwas one of the greatest moments of my life. A mere\\n 600 seconds of elegant fight washed off our entire fatigue\\n in an instant What a wonderful culmination of our years of\\n labour. Iwrote in my diary that night:\\n \\n Do not fook at Agni\\n as an entily directed upward\\n tb deter the ominous\\n or exhibit your might.\\n \\n Bis fire\\n \\n in the heart of an indian.\\n Do noteven give it\\n \\n the form of a missile\\n \\n as it clings to the\\n \\n burning pride of this nation\\n and thus is bright\\n \\n Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi called the Agni launch “a\\n major achievement in our continuing efforts to safeguard\\n ‘our independence and secuity by selfreliant means. The\\n technology demonstration through Agni is @ reflection of our\\n commitment to the indigenous development of advanced\\n technologies for the nation\\'s defence.\" “The country is\\n proud of your efforts,\" he told me. President Venkataraman\\n saw in the Agni success the fulfilment of his dream. He\\n cabled from Simla, ‘itis a tibute to your dedication, hard\\n work, and talent.\"\\n \\n A great deal of misinformation and disinformation had\\n been spread by vested interests about this technology\\n mmission. Agni had never been intended only as a nuclear\\n weapon system. What it did was to afford us the option of\\n developing the ability to deliver non-nuclear weapons with\\n high precision at long ranges. That it provided us with a\\n Viable nonnuclear option was of the greatest relevance to\\n contemporary strategic doctrines.\\n \\n Greatire was raised by the test firing of Agni, according\\n to a wellknown American defence journal, especially in the\\n United States where Congressmen threatened to put a\\n stop to all duaLuse and missile-related technologies, along\\n vith all muttinational aid.\\n \\n Gary Milhollin, a so-called specialist in missiles and\\n warhead technologies, had made a claim in The Wall\\n Street Journal that India had made Agni with the help of\\n West Germany. | had a hearty laugh reading that the\\n Geman Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) had\\n developed Agni\\'s guidance system, the first-stage rocket,\\n and a composite nose cone, and that the aerodynamic\\n model of Agni was tested in the DLR wind tunnel. An\\n immediate denial came from the DLR, who in tum\\n speculated that France had supplied the Agni guidance\\n electronics. American Senator Jeff Bingaman even went to\\n the extent of suggesting that | picked up everything needed\\n for Agni during my four-month stay at Wallop\\'s Island in\\n 1962. The fact that I was in Wallop\\'s Island more than 25\\n years ago and at that time the technology used in Agni did\\n not exist even in the United States was not mentioned.\\n \\x0chh today\\'s world, technological backwardness leads to\\n subjugation. Can we allow our freedom to be compromised\\n ‘on this account? it is our bounden duty to guarantee the\\n seourity and integrity of our nation against this threat\\n Should we not uphold the mandate bequeathed to us by our\\n forefathers who fought for the liberation of our country from\\n imperialism? Only when we are technologically self-reliant\\n vill we able to full their dream,\\n \\n Til the Agni launch, the Indian Armed Forces had been\\n structured for a stictly defensive role to safeguard our\\n nation, to shield our democrat processes from the\\n turbulence in the counties around us and to raise the cost\\n of any external intervention fo an unacceptable level for\\n counties which may entertain such notions. With Agri,\\n ndia had reached the stage where she had the option of\\n preventing wars involving her.\\n \\n Agni marked the completion of five years of IGMDP.\\n Now that it had demonstrated our competence in the crucial\\n area of re-entry technology and with tactical missiles ike\\n Prithvi and Trishul already testtfired, the launches of Nag\\n and Akash would take us into areas of competence where\\n there is little or no international competition. These two.\\n missile systems contained within themselves the stuff of\\n major technological breakthroughs. There was a need to\\n focus our efforts more intensively on them.\\n \\n h September 1989, I was invited by the Maharashtra\\n Academy of Sciences in Bombay to deliver the Jawaharlal\\n Nehru Memorial Lecture. I used this opportunity to share\\n with the budding scientists my plans of making an\\n indigenous Airto-Air missile, Astra. it would dovetail with\\n the development of the dian Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).\\n Hold them that our work in Imaging Infra Red (IR) and\\n Milimetric Wave (MMW) radar technology for the Nag\\n missile system had placed us in the vanguard of\\n international R&D efforts in missile technology. lalso drew\\n their attention to the crucial role that carbon-carbon and\\n other advanced composite materials play in mastering the\\n reenty technology. Agni was the conclusion of a\\n technological effort that was given its start by Prime\\n Minister hdira Gandhi when the country decided to break\\n free from the paralysing fetters of technological\\n backwardness and slough off the dead skin\\n subordination to industialized nations.\\n \\n The second fight of Prithvi at the end of September\\n 1988 was again a great success. Prithvi has proved to be\\n the best surface-to-surface missile in the world today. can\\n carry 1000 kg of warhead to a distance of 250 km and\\n deliver it within a radius of 50 metres.

Father Erhart, Prof. Subramanyam,\\n Prof. yyamperumal Konar, or Prof. Thothathri lyengar there,\\n but it seemed to me that the stones of the St. Joseph\\'s\\n building stil cartied the imprint of the wisdom of those great\\n people. | shared with the young students my memories of\\n St Joseph\\'s and paid tibute to the teachers who had\\n moulded me.\\n \\n We celebrated the nation\\'s forlyfourth Independence\\n Day with the test firing of Akash. Prahlada and his team\\n evaluated a new solid propellant booster system based on\\n a composite modified double base propellant. This\\n propellant with its unprecedented high energy properties,\\n was crucial in assuring the long-range surface-to-air\\n missiles. The country had taken an important step in\\n ground-based air defence of winerable areas.\\n \\n Towards the end of 1990, Jadavpur University\\n conferred on me the honour of Doctor of Science at a\\n special convocation. I was a litte embarrassed at finding\\n my name mentioned along with that of the legendary Nelson\\n Mandela, who was also honoured at the same convocation,\\n What could I possible have in common with a legend ike\\n Mandela? Perhaps it was our persistence in our missions.\\n My mission of advancing rockety in my county was\\n perhaps nothing when compared with Mandela\\'s mission of\\n achieving dignity for a great mass of humanity, but there\\n was no difference in the intensity of our passions. “Be more\\n \\x0cdedicated to making solid achievements than in running\\n after swift but synthetic happiness,” was my advice to the\\n young audience.\\n \\n ‘The Missile Council declared 1991 the Year of Initiative\\n for DRDL and RCL. When we chose the route of concurrent\\n engineering in IGMDP, we selected a rough tack. With the\\n completion of developmental trials on Prithvi and Trishul,\\n ‘our choice was on test now. | exhorted my colleagues to\\n commence user tials within the year. I knew that it was\\n going to be a tough task, but that was not going to.\\n discourage us.\\n \\n Rear Admiral Mohan retired and his deputy, Kapoor,\\n was to take over Trishul. | had always admired Mohan\\'s\\n understanding of missile command guidance. This sailor-\\n teacher-scientist could outwit any other expert in the country\\n in this field. Iwill aways remember his candid exposition of\\n various aspects of the Command Line of Sight (CLOS)\\n guidance system during the Trishul meetings. Once, he\\n \\n d me a verse that he had composed to highlight the\\n woes of an IGMDP Project Director. it was a good way of\\n letting off steam:\\n \\n Impossible timeframes,\\n \\n PERT charts to boot\\n \\n Ave driving me almost crazy as a coot;\\n Presentations to MC add to one\\'s woes,\\n \\n F they solve anything, Heaven only knows.\\n Meetings on holidays, even at night,\\n \\n The family is fed up,\\n \\n And alf ready to fight\\n \\n My hands ave itching\\n \\n to tear my hair —\\n \\n But alas! thavent any more to tear\\n \\n told him, “I have handed over all my problems t my\\n best teams in DRDL, RCI, and other participating labs.\\n ‘That has given me a full head of hair.”\\n \\n The year 1991 began ona very ominous note. On the\\n right of 15 January 1991, the Gulf War broke out between\\n Fag and the Allied Forces led by the USA. In one stroke,\\n thanks to satelite television invading hdian skies by that\\n time, rockets and missiles captured the imagination of the\\n entire nation. People started discussing Scuds and\\n Patriots in coffee houses and tea shops. Children began\\n fying paper kites shaped ike missiles, and playing war\\n games along the lines of what they saw on American\\n television networks. The successful test firing of Prithvi and\\n Tishul during the course of the Gulf War was enough to\\n make an arvious nation relax The newspaper reports of\\n the programmable trajectory capability of the Prithvi and\\n Tishul guidance system, using microwave frequencies in\\n virtually unjammable bands, created widespread\\n awareness. The nation was quick to draw parallels\\n between the missiles operational in the Gulf War and our\\n ‘own warhead carriers. A common query encountered was\\n whether Prithvi was superior to. a Scud, whether Akash\\n could perform like 2 Patiot, and so on. Hearing a “Yes\" or\\n a “Why not?\" from me, people\\'s faces would light up with\\n pride and satisfaction.\\n \\n The Allied Forces had a marked technological edge, as\\n they were fielding systems built using the technologies of\\n the eighties and nineties. Iraq was fighting with the by-and-\\n large vintage weapon systems of the sixties and seventies.\\n \\n Now, this is where the key to the modern world order\\n lies— superiority through technology. Deprive the opponent\\n of the latest technology and then dictate your terms in an\\n unequal contest. When the Chinese war philosopher, Sun\\n \\x0cTau ruminated over 2000 years ago that what matters in\\n war is not decimating the enemy amy physically but\\n breaking his will so as to make him concede defeat in the\\n mind, he seems to have visualized the domination of\\n technology in the twentieth century theatres of war. The\\n mmissile force coupled with the electronic warfare used in\\n the Gulf War was a feast for military strategic experts. It\\n acted as a curtainraiser for the twentyfirst century war\\n scenario with missiles and electonic and information\\n warfare playing the lead roles.\\n \\n h hdia, even today, the term technology, for most\\n people, conjures up images of smoky steel mills or clanking\\n machines. This is a rather inadequate conception of what\\n technology denotes. The invention of the horse collar in the\\n Middle Ages led to major changes in agricultural methods,\\n and was as much a technological advance as the invention\\n of the Bessemer furnace centuries later. Moreover,\\n technology includes techniques as well as the machines\\n that may or may not be necessary to apply them. ttincludes\\n ways to make chemical reactions occur, ways to breed fish,\\n eradicate weeds, light theatres, treat patients, teach\\n history, fightwars, or even prevent them.\\n \\n Today, most advanced technological processes are\\n cartied out far from assembly lines or open hearths. Indeed,\\n in electronics, in space technology, in most of the new\\n industries, relative silence and clean surroundings are\\n characteristic, even essential. The assembly line, with the\\n ‘organization of armies of men, to carry out simple, routine.\\n functions is an anachronism. Our symbols of technology\\n must change before we can keep pace with changes in\\n technology itself. We should never forget that technology\\n feeds on itself. Technology makes more technology\\n possible. In fact, technological innovation consists of three\\n stages linked together in a self-reinforcing cycle. First,\\n there is the creative stage, with the blueprint of a feasible\\n idea. This is made real byits practical application, and this,\\n finally ends in its diffusion through society. The process is,\\n then complete; the loop is closed when the diffusion of\\n technology embodying the new idea in its tum helps\\n generate new creative ideas. Today, all over the developed\\n world, the time gap between each of the steps in this cycle\\n has been shortened. In India, we are just progressing\\n towards that stage—closing the loop.\\n \\n After the Gulf War concluded with the victory of the\\n technologically superior Allied Forces, over 500 scientists,\\n of DRDL and RCI gathered to discuss issues that had\\n emerged. | posed @ question before the assembly. was\\n technology or weapon symmetry with other nations feasible,\\n and if so, should it be attempted? The discussion led to\\n many more serious questions, such as, how to estabish\\n effective electronic warfare support? How to make missile\\n development proceed apace with the development of\\n equally necessary systems lke the LCA; and whatwere the\\n key areas where a push would bring progress?\\n \\n At the end of a lively discussion spread over three\\n hours, the consensus emerged that there was no way to\\n redress asymmetry in military capability except to have the\\n same capability in specific areas as your potential\\n ‘opponent. The scientists vowed to achieve a reduced CEP\\n inthe accuracy of Prithvi\\'s delivery, perfecting the Ka band\\n guidance system for Trishul and realising all carbon-carbon\\n re-enty control surfaces for Agni by the end of the year. The\\n vow was laterfufflled. The year also saw tubelaunched Nag\\n fights, and the manoeuvre of Tiishui at seven metres above\\n sea level, at speeds which exceeded three times the speed\\n of sound. The latter was a breakthrough in the develooment\\n \\x0cofan indigenous ship-launched anti-sea-skimmer missile.\\n \\n same year, | received an honorary degree of\\n Doctor of Science from the IT, Bombay. Inthe citation read\\n by Prof. B Nag on the occasion, | was described as ‘an\\n inspiration behind the creation of a solid technological\\n base from which India\\'s future aerospace programmes can\\n be launched to meet the challenges of the twentyfirst\\n century’. Well, perhaps Prof. Nag was only being polite, but\\n Ido believe that India will enter the next century with its own\\n satellite in geo-statonary orbit 36,000 km away in space,\\n positioned by its own launch vehicle. India will also become\\n a missile power. Ours is a country with temendous vitality\\n Even though the world may not see its full potential or feel\\n its ful power, no one dare ignore it any more.\\n \\n On 15 October, I tured sixty. | looked forward to\\n retirement and planned to open a school for the less\\n privileged children, My fiend, Prof. P Rama Rao, who was\\n heading the Department of Science and Technology in the\\n Government of India, even struck up a partnership with me\\n to establish what he called the Rao-Kalam school. We were\\n unanimous in our opinion that carrying out certain missions\\n and reaching certain milestones, however important they\\n may be or however impressive they might appear to be, is,\\n not all there is to life. But we had to postpone our plan as,\\n neither of us was relieved from our post by the Govemment\\n oflndia\\n Iwas during this period that | decided to put down my\\n memoirs and express my observations and opinions on\\n certain issues.\\n \\n The biggest problem Indian youth faced, | felt, was a\\n lack of clarity of vision, a lack of direction, twas then that |\\n decided to wite about the circumstances and people who\\n made me what lam today, the idea was not merely to pay\\n tribute to some individuals or highlight certain aspects of\\n my life. What I wanted to say was that no one, however\\n poor, underprivileged or small, need feel disheartened\\n about life. Problems are a part of life. Suffering is the\\n essence of success. As someone said:\\n \\n God has not promised\\n Skies alvays blue,\\n \\n Flover-stewn pathways\\n All our life through:\\n God has not promised\\n Sun without rain,\\n \\n Joy without sorrow\\n Peace without pain,\\n \\n Iwill note presumptuous enough to say that my life can\\n be a role model for anybody; but some poor child living in\\n an obscure place, in an underprivileged social setting may\\n find a little solace in the way my destiny has been shaped. It\\n could perhaps help such children liberate themselves from\\n the bondage of their illusory backwardness and\\n hopelessness. respective of where they are right now, they\\n should be aware that God is with them and when He is with\\n them, who can be against them?\\n \\n But God has promised\\n Strength for the day,\\n \\n Rest for the labour\\n Light for the way.\\n \\n T-has been my observation that most Indians suffer\\n unnecessary misery all their lives because they do not know\\n how to manage their emotions. They are paralysed by\\n some sort of a psychological inertia. Phrases like ‘the next\\n best alternative’, ‘the only feasible option or solution’, and\\n ‘til things take a tum for the better’ are commonplace in our\\n \\x0cbusiness conversations. Why not write about the deep-\\n rooted character traits which manifest themselves in such\\n widespread, selfdefeatist thought patterns and negative\\n behaviour? | have worked with many people and\\n ‘organizations and have had to deal with people who were\\n 0 fll of their own limitations that they had no other way to\\n prove their selfworth than by intimidating me. Why notwrite\\n about the victimization which is a hallmark of the tragedy of\\n Indian science and technology? And about the pathways to\\n organizational success? Let the latent fire in the heart of\\n every Indian acquire wings, and the glory of this great\\n county light up the sky.\\n \\x0c\\x0cLeaders\\n \\n echnology, unlike science, is a group activity. Itis not\\n based on individual intelligence, but on the interaction of\\n many people. | think the biggest success of IGMDP is not\\n the fact that in\\n \\n record time the country acquired the capability of\\n making five state-ofthe-art missile systems but that through\\n it, some superb teams of scientists and engineers have\\n been created. f someone asks me about my personal\\n achievements in Indian rockety, | would put it down to\\n having created a challenging environment for teams of\\n young people to work in\\n \\n h their formative stages, teams are much like children\\n in spirit. They are as excitable, as full of vitality, enthusiasm,\\n curiosity and the desire to please and excel. As with\\n children, however, these positive attributes can be\\n destroyed by the behaviour of misguided parents. For\\n teams to be successful, the environment must offer scope\\n for innovation. | confronted many such challenges during the\\n course of my work at DTD&P (Air), ISRO, DRDO and\\n elsewhere, but always ensured for my teams an\\n environment which allowed innovation and risk-taking.\\n \\n ‘When we first began creating project teams during the\\n SLV-3 project and later in IGMDP, people working in these\\n teams found themselves in the frontline of their\\n organizations’ ambitions. Since a great deal of\\n psychological investment had been made in these teams,\\n they became both highty visible and highly vulnerable. They\\n were personally expected to make a disproportionate\\n contribution to win collective glory.\\n \\n Iwas aware that any failure in the organizational support\\n system would negate the investment in team strategies.\\n ‘The teams would be relegated to the league of average\\n working groups and might fail even there, unable to meet\\n the high expectations set for them. On several occasions,\\n the organization was on the verge of losing its nerve and\\n imposing restraints. The high level of uncertainty and\\n complexity associated with team activity very often proves\\n fo be a trap for the unwary.\\n \\n h the early years of the SLV-3 project, | offen had to\\n counter nervousness of the top people because progress\\n ‘was not tangibly or immediately visible. Many felt that the\\n ‘organization had lost control over SLV-3, that the team\\n would run on unchecked, and cause chaos and confusion.\\n But on all occasions, these fears were proved imaginary.\\n There were many people in powerful positions in\\n organizations, for example at VSSC, who underestimated\\n ‘our responsibility and commitment to organizational\\n objectives. Dealing with such people was a crucial part of\\n the whole operation, and this was performed dexterously by\\n Dr Brahm Prakash\\n \\n ‘When you work as a project team, you need to develop\\n a complex view of the success criteria. There are always\\n multiple and often conflicting sets of expectations that exist\\n about a team\\'s performance. Then, quite often, the project\\n teams are virtually torn apart in their attempt to.\\n accommodate the needs and constraints of sub\\n contractors outside the organization and specialist\\n departments within the organization. Good project teams\\n are able to quickly identify the key person or people with\\n whom negotiations must take place. A crucial aspect of the\\n team leader\\'s role is to negotiate with these key people for\\n their requirements, and to ensure that the dialogue\\n \\x0ccontinues on a regular basis as the situation develops or\\n changes. If there is one thing outsiders dislike, it is\\n Unpleasant suprises. Good teams ensure that there are\\n none.\\n \\n ‘The SLV-3 team developed their own internal success\\n criteria. We articulated our standards, expectations and\\n objectives. We summarised what was needed to happen\\n for us to be successful and how we woud measure\\n success. For instance, how we were going to accompiish\\n ‘our tasks, who would do what and according to what\\n standards, what were the time limits and how would the\\n team conduct itself with reference to others in the\\n organization.\\n \\n The process of arriving at the success criteria within a\\n team is an intricate and skilled one because there are a lot\\n of things going on below the surface. On the surface, the\\n team is simply working to achieve the project\\'s goals. But |\\n have repeatedly seen how people are poor at articulating\\n what they want—until they see a work centte doing\\n something they don\\'t want them to do. A project team\\n member must in fact act ike a detective. He should probe\\n for clies as to how the project is proceeding, and then\\n piece together different bits of evidence to build up a clear,\\n comprehensive and deep understanding of the project\\'s,\\n requirements.\\n \\n At another level, the relationship between the project\\n teams and the work centres should be encouraged and\\n developed by the project leader. Both parties must he very\\n clear in their minds about their mutual interdependence and\\n the fact that both of them have a stake in the project At yet\\n another level, each side should assess the other\\'s\\n capabilities and identify areas of strength and weakness in\\n order to plan what needs doing and how it should be done.\\n h fact, the whole game can be seen as a process of\\n contracting. It is about exploring and arriving at an\\n agreement on what each party expects of the other, about\\n realistically understanding the constraints of the other party,\\n and about communicating the success criteria while\\n defining some simple rules about how the relationship is to\\n work; but above all, it\\'s the best means of developing clarity\\n in the relationship, both at the technical and personal levels,\\n in order to avoid any nasty suprises in the future. hh\\n IGMDP, Sivathanu Pillai and his team did some\\n remarkable work in this area through their home-grown\\n technique, PACE, which stands for Programme Analysis,\\n Control and Evaluation. Each day between 12 noon and 1\\n p.m., they would sit with a project team and a particular\\n work centre that was on the critical path and assess the\\n level of success among themselves. The excitement of\\n planning ways to succeed and the vision of future success\\n provide an irresistible form of motivation which, | have\\n found, always makes things happen.\\n \\n ‘The concept of Technology Management has its roots in\\n the Developmental Management models which originated\\n in the early Sixties out of a conflict between hamony-\\n seeking and outputoriented management structures. There\\n are basically two types of management orientations: primal,\\n which values an economic employee, and rational, which\\n values an organizational employee. My concept of\\n management is woven around an employee who is a\\n technology person. While the primal management school\\n recognizes people for their independence, and rational\\n management acknowledges them for their dependability, |\\n value them for their interdependence. Whereas the primal\\n manager champions independent enterprise and the\\n rational manager serves cooperation, | moot\\n \\n  \\n \\x0cinterdependent joint ventures, getting the forces together,\\n networking people, resources, time schedules, costs, and\\n \\n Abraham Maslow was the first person to suggest the\\n new psychology of self-actualization at a conceptual level. h\\n Europe, Rudolf Steiner and Reg Revans developed this,\\n concept into the system of individual leaming and\\n organizational renewal. The Anglo-German management\\n philosopher, Fritz Schumacher introduced Budahist\\n economics and authored the concept of “Small is\\n Beautiful. In the indian subcontinent, Mahatma Gandti\\n emphasized grass root level technology and put the\\n customer at the centre of the entire business activity. JRD\\n Tata brought in progressdriven infrastructure. Dr Homi\\n Jehangir Bhabha and Prof. Vikram Sarabhai launched the\\n igh, technology-based atomic energy and space\\n rogrammes with a clear-cut emphasis on the natural laws\\n of totality and flow. Advancing the developmental\\n philosophy of Dr Bhabha and Prof. Sarabhai, Dr MS\\n Swaminathan ushered the Green Revolution into. India\\n working on another natural principle of integrity. Dr\\n Verghese Kurien brought in a powerful cooperative\\n movement through a revolution in the dairy industry. Prof,\\n Satish Dhawan developed mission management concepts,\\n in space research. These are but a few examples of\\n individuals who have not only articulated but also\\n implemented their ideas, thus changing forever the face of\\n research and business orgarizations all over the world\\n \\n h the IGMDP, | attempted to integrate the vision of Prof.\\n Sarabhai and the mission of Prof. Dhawan by adapting the\\n high technology seting of Dr Brahm Prakash\\'s space\\n research. I attempted to add the natural law of Lateney in\\n founding the hdian Guided Missile Programme in order to\\n create a completely indigenous variety of technology\\n management. Let me use a metaphor to illuminate this.\\n \\n ‘The tree of technology management takes root only if\\n there is the selfactualization of needs, renewal,\\n interdependence, and natural flow. The growth patterns are\\n characteristic of the evolution process, which means that\\n things move in a combination of slow change and sudden\\n transformation; each transformation causes either a leap\\n info a new, more complex level or a devastating crash to\\n some earlier level; dominant models reach a certain peak\\n of success when they tum troublesome; and the rate of\\n change always accelerates,\\n \\n The stem of the tree is the molecular structure in which\\n all actions are formative, all policies are normative, and all\\n decisions are integrative. The branches of this tree are\\n resources, assets, operations, and products which are\\n nourished by the stem through a continuous performance\\n evaluation and corrective update.\\n \\n This tree of technology management, if carefully tended,\\n bears the fruits of an adaptive infrastructure: technological\\n empowerment of the institutions, the generation of technical\\n skills among people, and finally self-reliance of the nation\\n and improvement in the quality of life ofits citizenry.\\n \\n ‘When IGMDP was sanctioned in 1983, we did not have\\n an adequate technology base. A few pockets of expertise\\n were available, but we lacked the authority to uflize that\\n expert technology. The mut-project environment of the\\n programme provided a challenge, for five advanced missile\\n systems had to be simultaneously developed. This,\\n demanded judicious sharing of resources, establishing\\n priorities, and ongoing induction of manpower. Eventually,\\n the IGMDP had 78 partners, including 36 technology\\n \\x0ccentres and 41 production centres spread over public\\n seotor undertakings, ordnance factories, private industies,\\n and professional societies, hand-in hand with a wel-knit\\n bureaucratic structure in the Government. hh the\\n management of the Programme, as much as in the\\n technological inputs, we attempted to develop a model that\\n was appropriate, even tailor-made, for our very specific\\n needs and capabilities. We borrowed ideas that had been\\n developed elsewhere, but adapted them in the light of what\\n ‘we knew were our strengths and whatwe recognized as the\\n constraints we would be compelled to work under. Allin all,\\n the combination of appropriate management and our\\n cooperative endeavours helped to unearth the talent and\\n potential that lay unused in our research laboratories,\\n govemment institutions and private industries.\\n \\n ‘The Technology Management philosophy of IGMDP is\\n not exclusive to missile development. I represents the\\n national urge to succeed and an awareness that the world\\n will never again be directed by muscle or money power. hy\\n fact, both these powers will depend on technological\\n excellence. Technology respects only technology. And, as |\\n said in the beginning, technology, unlike science, is a group\\n activity. t does not grow only through individual intelligence,\\n but by inteligences interacting and ceaselessly individual\\n intelligence, but by intelligences interacting and ceaselessly\\n strong hdian family which also makes missile systems\\n \\n There has been much speculation and philosophizing\\n about the life and times of our scientists, but not enough\\n exploration in detemining where they wanted to go and\\n how they reached there. Ih sharing with you the story of my\\n struggle to become a person, [have perhaps given you\\n some insight into this joumey. | hope it will help at least a\\n few young people to stand up to the authoritarianism in our\\n society. A characteristic feature of this social\\n authoritarianism is its insidious ability to addict people to\\n the endless pursuit of extemal rewards, wealth, prestige,\\n position, promotion, approval of one\\'s lifestyle by others,\\n ceremorial honours, and status symbols of all kinds.\\n \\n To successfully pursue these goals, they have to learn\\n elaborate rules of etiquette and familiarize themselves with\\n customs, traditions, protocols and so on. The youth of today\\n must unleam this self-defeating way of life. The culture of\\n ‘working only for material possessions and rewards must be\\n discarded. When | see wealthy, powerful and learned\\n people stugging to be at peace with themselves, |\\n remember people like Ahmed Jallaluddin and lyadurai\\n Solomon. How happy they were with virtually no\\n possessions!\\n \\n On the coast of Coromandet\\n Where the earthy shells blow\\n in the middle of the sands\\n Lived some really rich souls.\\n \\n ‘One cotfon fungi and half a candle —\\n \\n ‘One ofd jug without a handle\\n \\n These were all the worldly possessions\\n Of these kings in the middle of the sands.\\n \\n How did they feel so secure without anything to fall back\\n upon? | believe they drew sustenance from within. They\\n relied more on the inner signals and less on the extemal\\n cues that [have mentioned above. Are you aware of your\\n inner signals? Do you trust them? Have you taken control\\n ‘over your life into your own hands? Take this from me, the\\n more decisions you can make avoiding extemal pressures,\\n which will constantly try fo manipulate you, the better your\\n life will be, the better your society will become. Infact the\\n \\x0centire nation will benefit by having strong, inwardlooking\\n people as their leaders. A citizenry that thinks for itself, a\\n county of people who trust themselves as individuals,\\n would be virtually immune to manipulation by any\\n unscrupulous authority or vested interest.\\n \\n Your willingness to use your own inner resources to\\n invest in your life, especially your imagination, will bring you\\n success. When you address a task from your own uniquely\\n individual standpoint, you become a whole person.\\n \\n ryone on this planet is sent forth by Him to cultivate.\\n all the creative potential within us and live at peace with our\\n ‘own choices. We differ in the way we make our choices\\n and evolve our destiny. Life is a difficut game. You can win\\n only by retaining your birthright to be a person. And to retain\\n is right, you will have to be wiling to take the social or\\n external risks involved in ignoring pressures to do things\\n the way others say they should be done. What will you call\\n Sivasubramaria lyer inviting me to have lunch in his\\n kitchen? Zohara, my sister, mortgaging her gold bangles\\n and chains to get me into engineering college? Prof.\\n Sponder insisting that I should sit with him in the front row\\n for the group photograph? Making a hovercraft ina motor-\\n garage setup? Sudhakar\\'s courage? Dr Brahm Prakash\\'s\\n support? Narayanan\\'s management? Venkataraman\\'s\\n vision? Arunachalam\\'s drive? Each is an example of a\\n strong inner strength and initiative.

represent to many of his countrymen the best aspects of Indian life Born in 1931 the son of a litte educated boatowner in Rameswaram Tamilnadu he had an unparalleled career as a defence scientist culminating inthe highest civilan award of India the Bharat Ratna  As chief of the countrys defence research and development programme Kalam demonstrated the great potential for dynamism and innovation that ested in seemingly moribund research establishments This is the story of Kalams rise from obscurity and his personal and professional struggles as well as the story of Agni Prithvi Akash Trishul and Nag missiles that have become household names in India and that have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international recokoning  At the same time as he has helped create Indias awesome weaponry Kalam has maintained the ascetic rigour of his personal life working 18 hours a day and practicing the veena With characteristic modesty Kalam ascribes the greatness of his achievement to the influence of his teachers and mentors He describes the struggles of his boyhood and youth bringing alive everyday life in a small town in South India and the inspirational role of educators He describes the role of visionary Indian scientists such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai and of the creation of a coordinated network of research institutions This is also the saga of independent hdias struggle for technological self sufficiency and defensive autonomy  a story as much about politics domestic and international as itis about science  Arun Tiwari worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam for over a decade in the Defence Research and Development Laboratory DRDL Hyderabad He is currently Director Cardiovascular Technology hstitute Hyderabad where he is pursuing Dr Kalams vision of developing costeffective medical devices using indigenous defence tecmology  Dr Kalamis now hdias President He was elected to hidias office bya huge majority in 2002 To the memory of my parents My Mother Sea waves golden sand pilgrims faith Rameswaram Mosque Street all merge into one My Mother You come to me like heavens caring arms Iremember the war days when life was challenge and toil Miles to walk hours before sunrise Waking to take lessons from the saintly teacher near the temple Again miles to the Arab teaching school Climb sandy hills to Railway Station Road Collect distribute newspapers to temple city citizens Few hours after sunrise going to school Evening business tme before study at right All this pain of a young boy  Mother you transformed into pious strength  With kneeling and bowing five times For the Grace of the Almighty only My Mother Your strong piety is your childrens strength You always shared your best with whoever needed the most You always gave and gave with faith in Him Istil remember the day when lwas ten Sleeping on your lap to the envy of my elder brothers and sisters ftwas full moon night my world only you knew Mother My Mother When at midnight I woke with tears falling on my knee You knew the pain of your child My Mother Your caring hands tenderly removing the pain Your love your care your faith gave me strength To face the world without fear and with His strength We will meet again on the great Judgement Day My ier APJ Abdut Katam Contents Preface Acknowedgements introduction ORENTATION CREATION PROPITIATION CONTEMPLATION Epilogue jace  1  have worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam for over a decade This might seem to disqualify me as his biographer and I certainly had no notion of being one One day while speaking to him   asked him if he had a message for young Indians His message fascinated me Later I mustered the courage to ask him about his recollections so that  could pen them down before they were buried irretrievably under the sands oftime  We had a long series of sittings late into the night and early under the fading stars of dawnall somehow stolen from his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day The profundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me He had tremendous vitality and obviously received immense pleasure from the world of ideas His conversation was not always easy to follow but was alvays fresh and stimulating There were complexities subtleties and  intriguing metaphors and subplots in his narrative but gradually the Unfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuous discourse  When Isat down to write this book elt that it required greater skills than  possessed But realising the importance of this task and regarding it an honour fo have been permitted to attempt it  prayed eamestly for the courage and calibre to complete it  This book is written for the ordinary people of India for whom Dr Kalam has an immense affection and of whom Dr Kalam is certainly one He has an intuitive rapport with the humblest and simplest people an indication of his own simplicity and innate spirituality  For myself writing this book has been like a pilgrimage Through Dr Kalam  was blessed with the revelation that the real joy of living can be found in only one wayin ones communion with an eternal source of hidden knowledge vwithin oneselfwhich each individual is bidden to seek and find for himself or herself Many of you may never meet Dr Kalam in person but  hope you will enjoy his company through this book and that he will become your spiritual friend  Icould include in this book only a few incidents among the many narrated to me by Dr Kalam In fact this book provides only a thumbnail sketch of Dr Kalams'"
